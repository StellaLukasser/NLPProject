o sancta simplicitas in what strange simplification and falsification man lives one can never cease wondering when once one has got eyes for beholding this marvel how we have made everything around us clear and free and easy and simple how we have been able to give our senses a passport to everything superficial our thoughts a godlike desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences how from the beginning we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom thoughtlessness imprudence heartiness and gaiety in order to enjoy life and only on this solidified granite like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself hitherto the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will the will to ignorance to the uncertain to the untrue not as its opposite but as its refinement it is to be hoped indeed that language here as elsewhere will not get over its awkwardness and that it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many refinements of gradation it is equally to be hoped that the incarnated tartuffery of morals which now belongs to our unconquerable flesh and blood will turn the words round in the mouths of us discerning ones here and there we understand it and laugh at the way in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this simplified thoroughly artificial suitably imagined and suitably falsified world at the way in which whether it will or not it loves error because as living itself it loves life after such a cheerful commencement a serious word would fain be heard it appeals to the most serious minds take care ye philosophers and friends of knowledge and beware of martyrdom of suffering for the truths sake even in your own defense it spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags it stupefies animalizes and brutalizes when in the struggle with danger slander suspicion expulsion and even worse consequences of enmity ye have at last to play your last card as protectors of truth upon earth as though the truth were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors and you of all people ye knights of the sorrowful countenance messrs loafers and cobweb spinners of the spirit finally ye know sufficiently well that it cannot be of any consequence if ye just carry your point ye know that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines and occasionally after yourselves than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping games before accusers and law courts rather go out of the way flee into concealment and have your masks and your ruses that ye may be mistaken for what you are or somewhat feared and pray dont forget the garden the garden with golden trellis work and have people around you who are as a garden or as music on the waters at eventide when already the day becomes a memory choose the good solitude the free wanton lightsome solitude which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever how poisonous how crafty how bad does every long war make one which cannot be waged openly by means of force how personal does a long fear make one a long watching of enemies of possible enemies these pariahs of society these long pursued badly persecuted ones also the compulsory recluses the spinozas or giordano brunos always become in the end even under the most intellectual masquerade and perhaps without being themselves aware of it refined vengeance seekers and poison brewers just lay bare the foundation of spinozas ethics and theology not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him the martyrdom of the philosopher his sacrifice for the sake of truth forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration deteriorated into a martyr into a stage and tribune bawler only that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear what spectacle one will see in any case merely a satyric play merely an epilogue farce merely the continued proof that the long real tragedy is at an end supposing that every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy where he is free from the crowd the many the majority where he may forget men who are the rule as their exception exclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense whoever in intercourse with men does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress owing to disgust satiety sympathy gloominess and solitariness is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes supposing however that he does not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself that he persistently avoids it and remains as i said quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel one thing is then certain he was not made he was not predestined for knowledge for as such he would one day have to say to himself the devil take my good taste but the rule is more interesting than the exception than myself the exception and he would go down and above all he would go inside the long and serious study of the average man and consequently much disguise self overcoming familiarity and bad intercourse all intercourse is bad intercourse except with ones equals that constitutes a necessary part of the life history of every philosopher perhaps the most disagreeable odious and disappointing part if he is fortunate however as a favourite child of knowledge should be he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task i mean so called cynics those who simply recognize the animal the commonplace and the rule in themselves and at the same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk of themselves and their like before witnesses sometimes they wallow even in books as on their own dung hill cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him or the scientific satyr speaks out there are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust namely where by a freak of nature genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy goat and ape as in the case of the abbe galiani the profoundest acutest and perhaps also filthiest man of his century he was far profounder than voltaire and consequently also a good deal more silent it happens more frequently as has been hinted that a scientific head is placed on an apes body a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul an occurrence by no means rare especially among doctors and moral physiologists and whenever anyone speaks without bitterness or rather quite innocently of man as a belly with two requirements and a head with one whenever any one sees seeks and wants to see only hunger sexual instinct and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions in short when any one speaks badly and not even ill of man then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently he ought in general to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation for the indignant man and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth or in place of himself the world god or society may indeed morally speaking stand higher than the laughing and self satisfied satyr but in every other sense he is the more ordinary more indifferent and less instructive case and no one is such a liar as the indignant man it is difficult to be understood especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotogati footnote like the river ganges presto among those only who think and live otherwise namely kurmagati footnote like the tortoise lento or at best froglike mandeikagati footnote like the frog staccato i do everything to be difficultly understood myself and one should be heartily grateful for the good will to some refinement of interpretation as regards the good friends however who are always too easy going and think that as friends they have a right to ease one does well at the very first to grant them a play ground and romping place for misunderstanding one can thus laugh still or get rid of them altogether these good friends and laugh then also what is most difficult to render from one language into another is the tempo of its style which has its basis in the character of the race or to speak more physiologically in the average tempo of the assimilation of its nutriment there are honestly meant translations which as involuntary vulgarizations are almost falsifications of the original merely because its lively and merry tempo which overleaps and obviates all dangers in word and expression could not also be rendered a german is almost incapacitated for presto in his language consequently also as may be reasonably inferred for many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free free spirited thought and just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience so aristophanes and petronius are untranslatable for him everything ponderous viscous and pompously clumsy all long winded and wearying species of style are developed in profuse variety among germans pardon me for stating the fact that even goethes prose in its mixture of stiffness and elegance is no exception as a reflection of the good old time to which it belongs and as an expression of german taste at a time when there was still a german taste which was a rococo taste in moribus et artibus lessing is an exception owing to his histrionic nature which understood much and was versed in many things he who was not the translator of bayle to no purpose who took refuge willingly in the shadow of diderot and voltaire and still more willingly among the roman comedy writers lessing loved also free spiritism in the tempo and flight out of germany but how could the german language even in the prose of lessing imitate the tempo of machiavelli who in his principe makes us breathe the dry fine air of florence and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to present long heavy difficult dangerous thoughts and a tempo of the gallop and of the best wantonest humour finally who would venture on a german translation of petronius who more than any great musician hitherto was a master of presto in invention ideas and words what matter in the end about the swamps of the sick evil world or of the ancient world when like him one has the feet of a wind the rush the breath the emancipating scorn of a wind which makes everything healthy by making everything run and with regard to aristophanes that transfiguring complementary genius for whose sake one pardons all hellenism for having existed provided one has understood in its full profundity all that there requires pardon and transfiguration there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on platos secrecy and sphinx like nature than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his death bed there was found no bible nor anything egyptian pythagorean or platonic but a book of aristophanes how could even plato have endured life a greek life which he repudiated without an aristophanes it is the business of the very few to be independent it is a privilege of the strong and whoever attempts it even with the best right but without being obliged to do so proves that he is probably not only strong but also daring beyond measure he enters into a labyrinth he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way becomes isolated and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience supposing such a one comes to grief it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor sympathize with it and he cannot any longer go back he cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men our deepest insights must and should appear as follies and under certain circumstances as crimes when they come unauthorizedly to the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them the exoteric and the esoteric as they were formerly distinguished by philosophers among the indians as among the greeks persians and mussulmans in short wherever people believed in gradations of rank and not in equality and equal rights are not so much in contradistinction to one another in respect to the exoteric class standing without and viewing estimating measuring and judging from the outside and not from the inside the more essential distinction is that the class in question views things from below upwards while the esoteric class views things from above downwards there are heights of the soul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically and if all the woe in the world were taken together who would dare to decide whether the sight of it would necessarily seduce and constrain to sympathy and thus to a doubling of the woe that which serves the higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment must be almost poison to an entirely different and lower order of human beings the virtues of the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher it might be possible for a highly developed man supposing him to degenerate and go to ruin to acquire qualities thereby alone for the sake of which he would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he had sunk there are books which have an inverse value for the soul and the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality or the higher and more powerful make use of them in the former case they are dangerous disturbing unsettling books in the latter case they are herald calls which summon the bravest to their bravery books for the general reader are always ill smelling books the odour of paltry people clings to them where the populace eat and drink and even where they reverence it is accustomed to stink one should not go into churches if one wishes to breathe pure air in our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art of nuance which is the best gain of life and we have rightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with yea and nay everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes the taste for the unconditional is cruelly befooled and abused until a man learns to introduce a little art into his sentiments and prefers to try conclusions with the artificial as do the real artists of life the angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace until it has suitably falsified men and things to be able to vent its passion upon them youth in itself even is something falsifying and deceptive later on when the young soul tortured by continual disillusions finally turns suspiciously against itself still ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience how it upbraids itself how impatiently it tears itself how it revenges itself for its long self blinding as though it had been a voluntary blindness in this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of ones sentiments one tortures ones enthusiasm with doubt one feels even the good conscience to be a danger as if it were the self concealment and lassitude of a more refined uprightness and above all one espouses upon principle the cause against youth a decade later and one comprehends that all this was also still youth throughout the longest period of human history one calls it the prehistoric period the value or non value of an action was inferred from its consequences the action in itself was not taken into consideration any more than its origin but pretty much as in china at present where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to its parents the retro operating power of success or failure was what induced men to think well or ill of an action let us call this period the pre moral period of mankind the imperative know thyself was then still unknown in the last ten thousand years on the other hand on certain large portions of the earth one has gradually got so far that one no longer lets the consequences of an action but its origin decide with regard to its worth a great achievement as a whole an important refinement of vision and of criterion the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in origin the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as the moral one the first attempt at self knowledge is thereby made instead of the consequences the origin what an inversion of perspective and assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and wavering to be sure an ominous new superstition a peculiar narrowness of interpretation attained supremacy precisely thereby the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite sense possible as origin out of an intention people were agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention the intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the present day is it not possible however that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of values owing to a new self consciousness and acuteness in man is it not possible that we may be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with would be distinguished negatively as ultra moral nowadays when at least among us immoralists the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in that which is not intentional and that all its intentionalness all that is seen sensible or sensed in it belongs to its surface or skin which like every skin betrays something but conceals still more in short we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom which first requires an explanation a sign moreover which has too many interpretations and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone that morality in the sense in which it has been understood hitherto as intention morality has been a prejudice perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness probably something of the same rank as astrology and alchemy but in any case something which must be surmounted the surmounting of morality in a certain sense even the self mounting of morality let that be the name for the long secret labour which has been reserved for the most refined the most upright and also the most wicked consciences of today as the living touchstones of the soul it cannot be helped the sentiment of surrender of sacrifice for ones neighbour and all self renunciation morality must be mercilessly called to account and brought to judgment just as the aesthetics of disinterested contemplation under which the emasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience there is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments for others and not for myself for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here and for one asking promptly are they not perhaps deceptions that they please him who has them and him who enjoys their fruit and also the mere spectator that is still no argument in their favour but just calls for caution let us therefore be cautious at whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays seen from every position the erroneousness of the world in which we think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light upon we find proof after proof thereof which would fain allure us into surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of things he however who makes thinking itself and consequently the spirit responsible for the falseness of the world an honourable exit which every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of he who regards this world including space time form and movement as falsely deduced would have at least good reason in the end to become distrustful also of all thinking has it not hitherto been playing upon us the worst of scurvy tricks and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to do what it has always been doing in all seriousness the innocence of thinkers has something touching and respect inspiring in it which even nowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request that it will give them honest answers for example whether it be real or not and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at a distance and other questions of the same description the belief in immediate certainties is a moral naivete which does honour to us philosophers but we have now to cease being merely moral men apart from morality such belief is a folly which does little honour to us if in middle class life an ever ready distrust is regarded as the sign of a bad character and consequently as an imprudence here among us beyond the middle class world and its yeas and nays what should prevent our being imprudent and saying the philosopher has at length a right to bad character as the being who has hitherto been most befooled on earth he is now under obligation to distrustfulness to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicion forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression for i myself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived and i keep at least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which philosophers struggle against being deceived why not it is nothing more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance it is in fact the worst proved supposition in the world so much must be conceded there could have been no life at all except upon the basis of perspective estimates and semblances and if with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers one wished to do away altogether with the seeming world well granted that you could do that at least nothing of your truth would thereby remain indeed what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of true and false is it not enough to suppose degrees of seemingness and as it were lighter and darker shades and tones of semblance different valeurs as the painters say why might not the world which concerns us be a fiction and to any one who suggested but to a fiction belongs an originator might it not be bluntly replied why may not this belong also belong to the fiction is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the subject just as towards the predicate and object might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar all respect to governesses but is it not time that philosophy should renounce governess faith o voltaire o humanity o idiocy there is something ticklish in the truth and in the search for the truth and if man goes about it too humanely il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien i wager he finds nothing supposing that nothing else is given as real but our world of desires and passions that we cannot sink or rise to any other reality but just that of our impulses for thinking is only a relation of these impulses to one another are we not permitted to make the attempt and to ask the question whether this which is given does not suffice by means of our counterparts for the understanding even of the so called mechanical or material world i do not mean as an illusion a semblance a representation in the berkeleyan and schopenhauerian sense but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions themselves as a more primitive form of the world of emotions in which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity which afterwards branches off and develops itself in organic processes naturally also refines and debilitates as a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions including self regulation assimilation nutrition secretion and change of matter are still synthetically united with one another as a primary form of life in the end it is not only permitted to make this attempt it is commanded by the conscience of logical method not to assume several kinds of causality so long as the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its furthest extent to absurdity if i may be allowed to say so that is a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays it follows from its definition as mathematicians say the question is ultimately whether we really recognize the will as operating whether we believe in the causality of the will if we do so and fundamentally our belief in this is just our belief in causality itself we must make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality will can naturally only operate on will and not on matter not on nerves for instance in short the hypothesis must be hazarded whether will does not operate on will wherever effects are recognized and whether all mechanical action inasmuch as a power operates therein is not just the power of will the effect of will granted finally that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of will namely the will to power as my thesis puts it granted that all organic functions could be traced back to this will to power and that the solution of the problem of generation and nutrition it is one problem could also be found therein one would thus have acquired the right to define all active force unequivocally as will to power the world seen from within the world defined and designated according to its intelligible character it would simply be will to power and nothing else what does not that mean in popular language god is disproved but not the devil on the contrary on the contrary my friends and who the devil also compels you to speak popularly as happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times with the french revolution that terrible farce quite superfluous when judged close at hand into which however the noble and visionary spectators of all europe have interpreted from a distance their own indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately until the text has disappeared under the interpretation so a noble posterity might once more misunderstand the whole of the past and perhaps only thereby make its aspect endurable or rather has not this already happened have not we ourselves been that noble posterity and in so far as we now comprehend this is it not thereby already past nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely because it makes people happy or virtuous excepting perhaps the amiable idealists who are enthusiastic about the good true and beautiful and let all kinds of motley coarse and good natured desirabilities swim about promiscuously in their pond happiness and virtue are no arguments it is willingly forgotten however even on the part of thoughtful minds that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as little counter arguments a thing could be true although it were in the highest degree injurious and dangerous indeed the fundamental constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full knowledge of it so that the strength of a mind might be measured by the amount of truth it could endure or to speak more plainly by the extent to which it required truth attenuated veiled sweetened damped and falsified but there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain portions of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and have a greater likelihood of success not to speak of the wicked who are happy a species about whom moralists are silent perhaps severity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development of strong independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle refined yielding good nature and habit of taking things easily which are prized and rightly prized in a learned man presupposing always to begin with that the term philosopher be not confined to the philosopher who writes books or even introduces his philosophy into books stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the free spirited philosopher which for the sake of german taste i will not omit to underline for it is opposed to german taste pour etre bon philosophe says this last great psychologist il faut etre sec clair sans illusion un banquier qui a fait fortune a une partie du caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie cest a dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est everything that is profound loves the mask the profoundest things have a hatred even of figure and likeness should not the contrary only be the right disguise for the shame of a god to go about in a question worth asking it would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing there are proceedings of such a delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable there are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the witness soundly one thereby obscures his recollection many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory in order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret shame is inventive they are not the worst things of which one is most ashamed there is not only deceit behind a mask there is so much goodness in craft i could imagine that a man with something costly and fragile to conceal would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like an old green heavily hooped wine cask the refinement of his shame requiring it to be so a man who has depths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may be ignorant his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes and equally so his regained security such a hidden nature which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication desires and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his friends and supposing he does not desire it his eyes will some day be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there and that it is well to be so every profound spirit needs a mask nay more around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask owing to the constantly false that is to say superficial interpretation of every word he utters every step he takes every sign of life he manifests one must subject oneself to ones own tests that one is destined for independence and command and do so at the right time one must not avoid ones tests although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous game one can play and are in the end tests made only before ourselves and before no other judge not to cleave to any person be it even the dearest every person is a prison and also a recess not to cleave to a fatherland be it even the most suffering and necessitous it is even less difficult to detach ones heart from a victorious fatherland not to cleave to a sympathy be it even for higher men into whose peculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight not to cleave to a science though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries apparently specially reserved for us not to cleave to ones own liberation to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird which always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it the danger of the flier not to cleave to our own virtues nor become as a whole a victim to any of our specialties to our hospitality for instance which is the danger of dangers for highly developed and wealthy souls who deal prodigally almost indifferently with themselves and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes a vice one must know how to conserve oneself the best test of independence a new order of philosophers is appearing i shall venture to baptize them by a name not without danger as far as i understand them as far as they allow themselves to be understood for it is their nature to wish to remain something of a puzzle these philosophers of the future might rightly perhaps also wrongly claim to be designated as tempters this name itself is after all only an attempt or if it be preferred a temptation will they be new friends of truth these coming philosophers very probably for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths but assuredly they will not be dogmatists it must be contrary to their pride and also contrary to their taste that their truth should still be truth for every one that which has hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts my opinion is my opinion another person has not easily a right to it such a philosopher of the future will say perhaps one must renounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people good is no longer good when ones neighbour takes it into his mouth and how could there be a common good the expression contradicts itself that which can be common is always of small value in the end things must be as they are and have always been the great things remain for the great the abysses for the profound the delicacies and thrills for the refined and to sum up shortly everything rare for the rare need i say expressly after all this that they will be free very free spirits these philosophers of the future as certainly also they will not be merely free spirits but something more higher greater and fundamentally different which does not wish to be misunderstood and mistaken but while i say this i feel under obligation almost as much to them as to ourselves we free spirits who are their heralds and forerunners to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding which like a fog has too long made the conception of free spirit obscure in every country of europe and the same in america there is at present something which makes an abuse of this name a very narrow prepossessed enchained class of spirits who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts prompt not to mention that in respect to the new philosophers who are appearing they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors briefly and regrettably they belong to the levellers these wrongly named free spirits as glib tongued and scribe fingered slaves of the democratic taste and its modern ideas all of them men without solitude without personal solitude blunt honest fellows to whom neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied only they are not free and are ludicrously superficial especially in their innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost all human misery and failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed a notion which happily inverts the truth entirely what they would fain attain with all their strength is the universal green meadow happiness of the herd together with security safety comfort and alleviation of life for every one their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines are called equality of rights and sympathy with all sufferers and suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be done away with we opposite ones however who have opened our eye and conscience to the question how and where the plant man has hitherto grown most vigorously believe that this has always taken place under the opposite conditions that for this end the dangerousness of his situation had to be increased enormously his inventive faculty and dissembling power his spirit had to develop into subtlety and daring under long oppression and compulsion and his will to life had to be increased to the unconditioned will to power we believe that severity violence slavery danger in the street and in the heart secrecy stoicism tempters art and devilry of every kind that everything wicked terrible tyrannical predatory and serpentine in man serves as well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite we do not even say enough when we only say this much and in any case we find ourselves here both with our speech and our silence at the other extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability as their antipodes perhaps what wonder that we free spirits are not exactly the most communicative spirits that we do not wish to betray in every respect what a spirit can free itself from and where perhaps it will then be driven and as to the import of the dangerous formula beyond good and evil with which we at least avoid confusion we are something else than libres penseurs liben pensatori free thinkers and whatever these honest advocates of modern ideas like to call themselves having been at home or at least guests in many realms of the spirit having escaped again and again from the gloomy agreeable nooks in which preferences and prejudices youth origin the accident of men and books or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us full of malice against the seductions of dependency which he concealed in honours money positions or exaltation of the senses grateful even for distress and the vicissitudes of illness because they always free us from some rule and its prejudice grateful to the god devil sheep and worm in us inquisitive to a fault investigators to the point of cruelty with unhesitating fingers for the intangible with teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible ready for any business that requires sagacity and acute senses ready for every adventure owing to an excess of free will with anterior and posterior souls into the ultimate intentions of which it is difficult to pry with foregrounds and backgrounds to the end of which no foot may run hidden ones under the mantles of light appropriators although we resemble heirs and spendthrifts arrangers and collectors from morning till night misers of our wealth and our full crammed drawers economical in learning and forgetting inventive in scheming sometimes proud of tables of categories sometimes pedants sometimes night owls of work even in full day yea if necessary even scarecrows and it is necessary nowadays that is to say inasmuch as we are the born sworn jealous friends of solitude of our own profoundest midnight and midday solitude such kind of men are we we free spirits and perhaps ye are also something of the same kind ye coming ones ye new philosophers the human soul and its limits the range of mans inner experiences hitherto attained the heights depths and distances of these experiences the entire history of the soul up to the present time and its still unexhausted possibilities this is the preordained hunting domain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt but how often must he say despairingly to himself a single individual alas only a single individual and this great forest this virgin forest so he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants and fine trained hounds that he could send into the history of the human soul to drive his game together in vain again and again he experiences profoundly and bitterly how difficult it is to find assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his curiosity the evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous hunting domains where courage sagacity and subtlety in every sense are required is that they are no longer serviceable just when the big hunt and also the great danger commences it is precisely then that they lose their keen eye and nose in order for instance to divine and determine what sort of history the problem of knowledge and conscience has hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi a person would perhaps himself have to possess as profound as bruised as immense an experience as the intellectual conscience of pascal and then he would still require that wide spread heaven of clear wicked spirituality which from above would be able to oversee arrange and effectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences but who could do me this service and who would have time to wait for such servants they evidently appear too rarely they are so improbable at all times eventually one must do everything oneself in order to know something which means that one has much to do but a curiosity like mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices pardon me i mean to say that the love of truth has its reward in heaven and already upon earth faith such as early christianity desired and not infrequently achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free spirited world which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind it and in it counting besides the education in tolerance which the imperium romanum gave this faith is not that sincere austere slave faith by which perhaps a luther or a cromwell or some other northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his god and christianity it is much rather the faith of pascal which resembles in a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason a tough long lived worm like reason which is not to be slain at once and with a single blow the christian faith from the beginning is sacrifice the sacrifice of all freedom all pride all self confidence of spirit it is at the same time subjection self derision and self mutilation there is cruelty and religious phoenicianism in this faith which is adapted to a tender many sided and very fastidious conscience it takes for granted that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably painful that all the past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum in the form of which faith comes to it modern men with their obtuseness as regards all christian nomenclature have no longer the sense for the terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by the paradox of the formula god on the cross hitherto there had never and nowhere been such boldness in inversion nor anything at once so dreadful questioning and questionable as this formula it promised a transvaluation of all ancient values it was the orient the profound orient it was the oriental slave who thus took revenge on rome and its noble light minded toleration on the roman catholicism of non faith and it was always not the faith but the freedom from the faith the half stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against them enlightenment causes revolt for the slave desires the unconditioned he understands nothing but the tyrannous even in morals he loves as he hates without nuance to the very depths to the point of pain to the point of sickness his many hidden sufferings make him revolt against the noble taste which seems to deny suffering the skepticism with regard to suffering fundamentally only an attitude of aristocratic morality was not the least of the causes also of the last great slave insurrection which began with the french revolution wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen solitude fasting and sexual abstinence but without its being possible to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect or if any relation at all of cause and effect exists there this latter doubt is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and excessive sensuality which then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential paroxysms world renunciation and will renunciation both symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy but nowhere is it more obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition no other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even to philosophers perhaps it is time to become just a little indifferent here to learn caution or better still to look away to go away yet in the background of the most recent philosophy that of schopenhauer we find almost as the problem in itself this terrible note of interrogation of the religious crisis and awakening how is the negation of will possible how is the saint possible that seems to have been the very question with which schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher and thus it was a genuine schopenhauerian consequence that his most convinced adherent perhaps also his last as far as germany is concerned namely richard wagner should bring his own life work to an end just here and should finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as kundry type vecu and as it loved and lived at the very time that the mad doctors in almost all european countries had an opportunity to study the type close at hand wherever the religious neurosis or as i call it the religious mood made its latest epidemical outbreak and display as the salvation army if it be a question however as to what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages and even to philosophers in the whole phenomenon of the saint it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein namely the immediate succession of opposites of states of the soul regarded as morally antithetical it was believed here to be self evident that a bad man was all at once turned into a saint a good man the hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point is it not possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed itself under the dominion of morals because it believed in oppositions of moral values and saw read and interpreted these oppositions into the text and facts of the case what miracle only an error of interpretation a lack of philology it seems that the latin races are far more deeply attached to their catholicism than we northerners are to christianity generally and that consequently unbelief in catholic countries means something quite different from what it does among protestants namely a sort of revolt against the spirit of the race while with us it is rather a return to the spirit or non spirit of the race northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races even as regards our talents for religion we have poor talents for it one may make an exception in the case of the celts who have theretofore furnished also the best soil for christian infection in the north the christian ideal blossomed forth in france as much as ever the pale sun of the north would allow it how strangely pious for our taste are still these later french skeptics whenever there is any celtic blood in their origin how catholic how un german does auguste comtes sociology seem to us with the roman logic of its instincts how jesuitical that amiable and shrewd cicerone of port royal sainte beuve in spite of all his hostility to jesuits and even ernest renan how inaccessible to us northerners does the language of such a renan appear in whom every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance let us repeat after him these fine sentences and what wickedness and haughtiness is immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful but harder souls that is to say in our more german souls disons donc hardiment que la religion est un produit de lhomme normal que lhomme est le plus dans le vrai quant il est le plus religieux et le plus assure dune destinee infinie cest quand il est bon quil veut que la virtu corresponde a un order eternal cest quand il contemple les choses dune maniere desinteressee quil trouve la mort revoltante et absurde comment ne pas supposer que cest dans ces moments la que lhomme voit le mieux these sentences are so extremely antipodal to my ears and habits of thought that in my first impulse of rage on finding them i wrote on the margin la niaiserie religieuse par excellence until in my later rage i even took a fancy to them these sentences with their truth absolutely inverted it is so nice and such a distinction to have ones own antipodes that which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient greeks is the irrestrainable stream of gratitude which it pours forth it is a very superior kind of man who takes such an attitude towards nature and life later on when the populace got the upper hand in greece fear became rampant also in religion and christianity was preparing itself the passion for god there are churlish honest hearted and importunate kinds of it like that of luther the whole of protestantism lacks the southern delicatezza there is an oriental exaltation of the mind in it like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave as in the case of st augustine for instance who lacks in an offensive manner all nobility in bearing and desires there is a feminine tenderness and sensuality in it which modestly and unconsciously longs for a unio mystica et physica as in the case of madame de guyon in many cases it appears curiously enough as the disguise of a girls or youths puberty here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid also as her last ambition the church has frequently canonized the woman in such a case the mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before the saint as the enigma of self subjugation and utter voluntary privation why did they thus bow they divined in him and as it were behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance the superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation the strength of will in which they recognized their own strength and love of power and knew how to honour it they honoured something in themselves when they honoured the saint in addition to this the contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion such an enormity of self negation and anti naturalness will not have been coveted for nothing they have said inquiringly there is perhaps a reason for it some very great danger about which the ascetic might wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and visitors in a word the mighty ones of the world learned to have a new fear before him they divined a new power a strange still unconquered enemy it was the will to power which obliged them to halt before the saint they had to question him in the jewish old testament the book of divine justice there are men things and sayings on such an immense scale that greek and indian literature has nothing to compare with it one stands with fear and reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly and one has sad thoughts about old asia and its little out pushed peninsula europe which would like by all means to figure before asia as the progress of mankind to be sure he who is himself only a slender tame house animal and knows only the wants of a house animal like our cultured people of today including the christians of cultured christianity need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins the taste for the old testament is a touchstone with respect to great and small perhaps he will find that the new testament the book of grace still appeals more to his heart there is much of the odour of the genuine tender stupid beadsman and petty soul in it to have bound up this new testament a kind of rococo of taste in every respect along with the old testament into one book as the bible as the book in itself is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the spirit which literary europe has upon its conscience why atheism nowadays the father in god is thoroughly refuted equally so the judge the rewarder also his free will he does not hear and even if he did he would not know how to help the worst is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly is he uncertain this is what i have made out by questioning and listening at a variety of conversations to be the cause of the decline of european theism it appears to me that though the religious instinct is in vigorous growth it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound distrust what does all modern philosophy mainly do since descartes and indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure an attentat has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old conception of the soul under the guise of a criticism of the subject and predicate conception that is to say an attentat on the fundamental presupposition of christian doctrine modern philosophy as epistemological skepticism is secretly or openly anti christian although for keener ears be it said by no means anti religious formerly in effect one believed in the soul as one believed in grammar and the grammatical subject one said i is the condition think is the predicate and is conditioned to think is an activity for which one must suppose a subject as cause the attempt was then made with marvelous tenacity and subtlety to see if one could not get out of this net to see if the opposite was not perhaps true think the condition and i the conditioned i therefore only a synthesis which has been made by thinking itself kant really wished to prove that starting from the subject the subject could not be proved nor the object either the possibility of an apparent existence of the subject and therefore of the soul may not always have been strange to him the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the vedanta philosophy there is a great ladder of religious cruelty with many rounds but three of these are the most important once on a time men sacrificed human beings to their god and perhaps just those they loved the best to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive religions and also the sacrifice of the emperor tiberius in the mithra grotto on the island of capri that most terrible of all roman anachronisms then during the moral epoch of mankind they sacrificed to their god the strongest instincts they possessed their nature this festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and anti natural fanatics finally what still remained to be sacrificed was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting holy healing all hope all faith in hidden harmonies in future blessedness and justice was it not necessary to sacrifice god himself and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone stupidity gravity fate nothingness to sacrifice god for nothingness this paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the rising generation we all know something thereof already whoever like myself prompted by some enigmatical desire has long endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it from the half christian half german narrowness and stupidity in which it has finally presented itself to this century namely in the form of schopenhauers philosophy whoever with an asiatic and super asiatic eye has actually looked inside and into the most world renouncing of all possible modes of thought beyond good and evil and no longer like buddha and schopenhauer under the dominion and delusion of morality whoever has done this has perhaps just thereby without really desiring it opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal the ideal of the most world approving exuberant and vivacious man who has not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and is but wishes to have it again as it was and is for all eternity insatiably calling out da capo not only to himself but to the whole piece and play and not only the play but actually to him who requires the play and makes it necessary because he always requires himself anew and makes himself necessary what and this would not be circulus vitiosus deus the distance and as it were the space around man grows with the strength of his intellectual vision and insight his world becomes profounder new stars new enigmas and notions are ever coming into view perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise something of a game something for children and childish minds perhaps the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and suffering the conceptions god and sin will one day seem to us of no more importance than a childs plaything or a childs pain seems to an old man and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be necessary once more for the old man always childish enough an eternal child has it been observed to what extent outward idleness or semi idleness is necessary to a real religious life alike for its favourite microscopic labour of self examination and for its soft placidity called prayer the state of perpetual readiness for the coming of god i mean the idleness with a good conscience the idleness of olden times and of blood to which the aristocratic sentiment that work is dishonouring that it vulgarizes body and soul is not quite unfamiliar and that consequently the modern noisy time engrossing conceited foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for unbelief more than anything else among these for instance who are at present living apart from religion in germany i find free thinkers of diversified species and origin but above all a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious instincts so that they no longer know what purpose religions serve and only note their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment they feel themselves already fully occupied these good people be it by their business or by their pleasures not to mention the fatherland and the newspapers and their family duties it seems that they have no time whatever left for religion and above all it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of a new business or a new pleasure for it is impossible they say to themselves that people should go to church merely to spoil their tempers they are by no means enemies of religious customs should certain circumstances state affairs perhaps require their participation in such customs they do what is required as so many things are done with a patient and unassuming seriousness and without much curiosity or discomfort they live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a for or against in such matters among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of german protestants of the middle classes especially in the great laborious centres of trade and commerce also the majority of laborious scholars and the entire university personnel with the exception of the theologians whose existence and possibility there always gives psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve on the part of pious or merely church going people there is seldom any idea of how much good will one might say arbitrary will is now necessary for a german scholar to take the problem of religion seriously his whole profession and as i have said his whole workmanlike laboriousness to which he is compelled by his modern conscience inclines him to a lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion with which is occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spirit which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the church it is only with the help of history not through his own personal experience therefore that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness and to a certain timid deference in presence of religions but even when his sentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them he has not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as church or as piety perhaps even the contrary the practical indifference to religious matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up usually sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness which shuns contact with religious men and things and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it every age has its own divine type of naivete for the discovery of which other ages may envy it and how much naivete adorable childlike and boundlessly foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority in the good conscience of his tolerance in the unsuspecting simple certainty with which his instinct treats the religious man as a lower and less valuable type beyond before and above which he himself has developed he the little arrogant dwarf and mob man the sedulously alert head and hand drudge of ideas of modern ideas whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial it is their preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty lightsome and false here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration of pure forms in philosophers as well as in artists it is not to be doubted that whoever has need of the cult of the superficial to that extent has at one time or another made an unlucky dive beneath it perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt children the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to falsify its image as if taking wearisome revenge on it one might guess to what degree life has disgusted them by the extent to which they wish to see its image falsified attenuated ultrified and deified one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists as their highest rank it is the profound suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence the fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be attained too soon before man has become strong enough hard enough artist enough piety the life in god regarded in this light would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate product of the fear of truth as artist adoration and artist intoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsifications as the will to the inversion of truth to untruth at any price perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means of beautifying man than piety by means of it man can become so artful so superficial so iridescent and so good that his appearance no longer offends to love mankind for gods sake this has so far been the noblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained that love to mankind without any redeeming intention in the background is only an additional folly and brutishness that the inclination to this love has first to get its proportion its delicacy its gram of salt and sprinkling of ambergris from a higher inclination whoever first perceived and experienced this however his tongue may have stammered as it attempted to express such a delicate matter let him for all time be holy and respected as the man who has so far flown highest and gone astray in the finest fashion the philosopher as we free spirits understand him as the man of the greatest responsibility who has the conscience for the general development of mankind will use religion for his disciplining and educating work just as he will use the contemporary political and economic conditions the selecting and disciplining influence destructive as well as creative and fashioning which can be exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied according to the sort of people placed under its spell and protection for those who are strong and independent destined and trained to command in whom the judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated religion is an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of authority as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter their inmost heart which would fain escape obedience and in the case of the unique natures of noble origin if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative life reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government over chosen disciples or members of an order religion itself may be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing grosser affairs and for securing immunity from the unavoidable filth of all political agitation the brahmins for instance understood this fact with the help of a religious organization they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the people while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside as men with a higher and super regal mission at the same time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes in which through fortunate marriage customs volitional power and delight in self control are on the increase to them religion offers sufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality and to experience the sentiments of authoritative self control of silence and of solitude asceticism and puritanism are almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy and finally to ordinary men to the majority of the people who exist for service and general utility and are only so far entitled to exist religion gives invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition peace of heart ennoblement of obedience additional social happiness and sympathy with something of transfiguration and embellishment something of justification of all the commonplaceness all the meanness all the semi animal poverty of their souls religion together with the religious significance of life sheds sunshine over such perpetually harassed men and makes even their own aspect endurable to them it operates upon them as the epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order in a refreshing and refining manner almost turning suffering to account and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it there is perhaps nothing so admirable in christianity and buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to live this very difficulty being necessary to be sure to make also the bad counter reckoning against such religions and to bring to light their secret dangers the cost is always excessive and terrible when religions do not operate as an educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher but rule voluntarily and paramountly when they wish to be the final end and not a means along with other means among men as among all other animals there is a surplus of defective diseased degenerating infirm and necessarily suffering individuals the successful cases among men also are always the exception and in view of the fact that man is the animal not yet properly adapted to his environment the rare exception but worse still the higher the type a man represents the greater is the improbability that he will succeed the accidental the law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind manifests itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of men the conditions of whose lives are delicate diverse and difficult to determine what then is the attitude of the two greatest religions above mentioned to the surplus of failures in life they endeavour to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved in fact as the religions for sufferers they take the part of these upon principle they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease and they would fain treat every other experience of life as false and impossible however highly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative care inasmuch as in applying to others it has applied and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man the hitherto paramount religions to give a general appreciation of them are among the principal causes which have kept the type of man upon a lower level they have preserved too much that which should have perished one has to thank them for invaluable services and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that the spiritual men of christianity have done for europe hitherto but when they had given comfort to the sufferers courage to the oppressed and despairing a staff and support to the helpless and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken hearted and distracted what else had they to do in order to work systematically in that fashion and with a good conscience for the preservation of all the sick and suffering which means in deed and in truth to work for the deterioration of the european race to reverse all estimates of value that is what they had to do and to shatter the strong to spoil great hopes to cast suspicion on the delight in beauty to break down everything autonomous manly conquering and imperious all instincts which are natural to the highest and most successful type of man into uncertainty distress of conscience and self destruction forsooth to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over the earth into hatred of the earth and earthly things that is the task the church imposed on itself and was obliged to impose until according to its standard of value unworldliness unsensuousness and higher man fused into one sentiment if one could observe the strangely painful equally coarse and refined comedy of european christianity with the derisive and impartial eye of an epicurean god i should think one would never cease marvelling and laughing does it not actually seem that some single will has ruled over europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a sublime abortion of man he however who with opposite requirements no longer epicurean and with some divine hammer in his hand could approach this almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind as exemplified in the european christian pascal for instance would he not have to cry aloud with rage pity and horror oh you bunglers presumptuous pitiful bunglers what have you done was that a work for your hands how you have hacked and botched my finest stone what have you presumed to do i should say that christianity has hitherto been the most portentous of presumptions men not great enough nor hard enough to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning man men not sufficiently strong and far sighted to allow with sublime self constraint the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and perishings to prevail men not sufficiently noble to see the radically different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from man such men with their equality before god have hitherto swayed the destiny of europe until at last a dwarfed almost ludicrous species has been produced a gregarious animal something obliging sickly mediocre the european of the present day the moral sentiment in europe at present is perhaps as subtle belated diverse sensitive and refined as the science of morals belonging thereto is recent initial awkward and coarse fingered an interesting contrast which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist indeed the expression science of morals is in respect to what is designated thereby far too presumptuous and counter to good taste which is always a foretaste of more modest expressions one ought to avow with the utmost fairness what is still necessary here for a long time what is alone proper for the present namely the collection of material the comprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth and distinctions of worth which live grow propagate and perish and perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living crystallizations as preparation for a theory of types of morality to be sure people have not hitherto been so modest all the philosophers with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness demanded of themselves something very much higher more pretentious and ceremonious when they concerned themselves with morality as a science they wanted to give a basic to morality and every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it a basis morality itself however has been regarded as something given how far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem left in dust and decay of a description of forms of morality notwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it it was precisely owing to moral philosophers knowing the moral facts imperfectly in an arbitrary epitome or an accidental abridgement perhaps as the morality of their environment their position their church their zeitgeist their climate and zone it was precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nations eras and past ages and were by no means eager to know about these matters that they did not even come in sight of the real problems of morals problems which only disclose themselves by a comparison of many kinds of morality in every science of morals hitherto strange as it may sound the problem of morality itself has been omitted there has been no suspicion that there was anything problematic there that which philosophers called giving a basis to morality and endeavoured to realize has when seen in a right light proved merely a learned form of good faith in prevailing morality a new means of its expression consequently just a matter of fact within the sphere of a definite morality yea in its ultimate motive a sort of denial that it is lawful for this morality to be called in question and in any case the reverse of the testing analyzing doubting and vivisecting of this very faith hear for instance with what innocence almost worthy of honour schopenhauer represents his own task and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a science whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and old wives the principle he says page of the grundprobleme der ethik footnote pages of schopenhauers basis of morality translated by arthur b bullock ma the axiom about the purport of which all moralists are practically agreed neminem laede immo omnes quantum potes juva is really the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish the real basis of ethics which has been sought like the philosophers stone for centuries the difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great it is well known that schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is in a world whose essence is will to power may be reminded that schopenhauer although a pessimist actually played the flute daily after dinner one may read about the matter in his biography a question by the way a pessimist a repudiator of god and of the world who makes a halt at morality who assents to morality and plays the flute to laede neminem morals what is that really a pessimist apart from the value of such assertions as there is a categorical imperative in us one can always ask what does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it there are systems of morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people other systems of morals are meant to tranquilize him and make him self satisfied with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself with others he wishes to take revenge with others to conceal himself with others to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction this system of morals helps its author to forget that system makes him or something of him forgotten many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind many another perhaps kant especially gives us to understand by his morals that what is estimable in me is that i know how to obey and with you it shall not be otherwise than with me in short systems of morals are only a sign language of the emotions in contrast to laisser aller every system of morals is a sort of tyranny against nature and also against reason that is however no objection unless one should again decree by some system of morals that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful what is essential and invaluable in every system of morals is that it is a long constraint in order to understand stoicism or port royal or puritanism one should remember the constraint under which every language has attained to strength and freedom the metrical constraint the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm how much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation given themselves not excepting some of the prose writers of today in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness for the sake of a folly as utilitarian bunglers say and thereby deem themselves wise from submission to arbitrary laws as the anarchists say and thereby fancy themselves free even free spirited the singular fact remains however that everything of the nature of freedom elegance boldness dance and masterly certainty which exists or has existed whether it be in thought itself or in administration or in speaking and persuading in art just as in conduct has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law and in all seriousness it is not at all improbable that precisely this is nature and natural and not laisser aller every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go is his most natural condition the free arranging locating disposing and constructing in the moments of inspiration and how strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand laws which by their very rigidness and precision defy all formulation by means of ideas even the most stable idea has in comparison therewith something floating manifold and ambiguous in it the essential thing in heaven and in earth is apparently to repeat it once more that there should be long obedience in the same direction there thereby results and has always resulted in the long run something which has made life worth living for instance virtue art music dancing reason spirituality anything whatever that is transfiguring refined foolish or divine the long bondage of the spirit the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rules of a church or a court or conformable to aristotelian premises the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that happened according to a christian scheme and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the christian god all this violence arbitrariness severity dreadfulness and unreasonableness has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the european spirit has attained its strength its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled suffocated and spoilt in the process for here as everywhere nature shows herself as she is in all her extravagant and indifferent magnificence which is shocking but nevertheless noble that for centuries european thinkers only thought in order to prove something nowadays on the contrary we are suspicious of every thinker who wishes to prove something that it was always settled beforehand what was to be the result of their strictest thinking as it was perhaps in the asiatic astrology of former times or as it is still at the present day in the innocent christian moral explanation of immediate personal events for the glory of god or for the good of the soul this tyranny this arbitrariness this severe and magnificent stupidity has educated the spirit slavery both in the coarser and the finer sense is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual education and discipline one may look at every system of morals in this light it is nature therein which teaches to hate the laisser aller the too great freedom and implants the need for limited horizons for immediate duties it teaches the narrowing of perspectives and thus in a certain sense that stupidity is a condition of life and development thou must obey some one and for a long time otherwise thou wilt come to grief and lose all respect for thyself this seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature which is certainly neither categorical as old kant wished consequently the otherwise nor does it address itself to the individual what does nature care for the individual but to nations races ages and ranks above all however to the animal man generally to mankind industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle it was a master stroke of english instinct to hallow and begloom sunday to such an extent that the englishman unconsciously hankers for his week and work day again as a kind of cleverly devised cleverly intercalated fast such as is also frequently found in the ancient world although as is appropriate in southern nations not precisely with respect to work many kinds of fasts are necessary and wherever powerful influences and habits prevail legislators have to see that intercalary days are appointed on which such impulses are fettered and learn to hunger anew viewed from a higher standpoint whole generations and epochs when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting during which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself at the same time also to purify and sharpen itself certain philosophical sects likewise admit of a similar interpretation for instance the stoa in the midst of hellenic culture with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with aphrodisiacal odours here also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox why it was precisely in the most christian period of european history and in general only under the pressure of christian sentiments that the sexual impulse sublimated into love amour passion there is something in the morality of plato which does not really belong to plato but which only appears in his philosophy one might say in spite of him namely socratism for which he himself was too noble no one desires to injure himself hence all evil is done unwittingly the evil man inflicts injury on himself he would not do so however if he knew that evil is evil the evil man therefore is only evil through error if one free him from error one will necessarily make him good this mode of reasoning savours of the populace who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil doing and practically judge that it is stupid to do wrong while they accept good as identical with useful and pleasant without further thought as regards every system of utilitarianism one may at once assume that it has the same origin and follow the scent one will seldom err plato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher and above all to interpret himself into them he the most daring of all interpreters who lifted the entire socrates out of the street as a popular theme and song to exhibit him in endless and impossible modifications namely in all his own disguises and multiplicities in jest and in homeric language as well what is the platonic socrates if not greek words inserted here the old theological problem of faith and knowledge or more plainly of instinct and reason the question whether in respect to the valuation of things instinct deserves more authority than rationality which wants to appreciate and act according to motives according to a why that is to say in conformity to purpose and utility it is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of socrates and had divided mens minds long before christianity socrates himself following of course the taste of his talent that of a surpassing dialectician took first the side of reason and in fact what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble athenians who were men of instinct like all noble men and could never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions in the end however though silently and secretly he laughed also at himself with his finer conscience and introspection he found in himself the same difficulty and incapacity but why he said to himself should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts one must set them right and the reason also one must follow the instincts but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments this was the real falseness of that great and mysterious ironist he brought his conscience up to the point that he was satisfied with a kind of self outwitting in fact he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment plato more innocent in such matters and without the craftiness of the plebeian wished to prove to himself at the expenditure of all his strength the greatest strength a philosopher had ever expended that reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal to the good to god and since plato all theologians and philosophers have followed the same path which means that in matters of morality instinct or as christians call it faith or as i call it the herd has hitherto triumphed unless one should make an exception in the case of descartes the father of rationalism and consequently the grandfather of the revolution who recognized only the authority of reason but reason is only a tool and descartes was superficial whoever has followed the history of a single science finds in its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest processes of all knowledge and cognizance there as here the premature hypotheses the fictions the good stupid will to belief and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed our senses learn late and never learn completely to be subtle reliable and cautious organs of knowledge our eyes find it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already often produced than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of an impression the latter requires more force more morality it is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new we hear strange music badly when we hear another language spoken we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words with which we are more familiar and conversant it was thus for example that the germans modified the spoken word arcubalista into armbrust cross bow our senses are also hostile and averse to the new and generally even in the simplest processes of sensation the emotions dominate such as fear love hatred and the passive emotion of indolence as little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words not to speak of syllables of a page he rather takes about five out of every twenty words at random and guesses the probably appropriate sense to them just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to its leaves branches colour and shape we find it so much easier to fancy the chance of a tree even in the midst of the most remarkable experiences we still do just the same we fabricate the greater part of the experience and can hardly be made to contemplate any event except as inventors thereof all this goes to prove that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have been accustomed to lying or to express it more politely and hypocritically in short more pleasantly one is much more of an artist than one is aware of in an animated conversation i often see the face of the person with whom i am speaking so clearly and sharply defined before me according to the thought he expresses or which i believe to be evoked in his mind that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the strength of my visual faculty the delicacy of the play of the muscles and of the expression of the eyes must therefore be imagined by me probably the person put on quite a different expression or none at all quidquid luce fuit tenebris agit but also contrariwise what we experience in dreams provided we experience it often pertains at last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything actually experienced by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer we have a requirement more or less and finally in broad daylight and even in the brightest moments of our waking life we are ruled to some extent by the nature of our dreams supposing that someone has often flown in his dreams and that at last as soon as he dreams he is conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable happiness such a person who believes that on the slightest impulse he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles who knows the sensation of a certain divine levity an upwards without effort or constraint a downwards without descending or lowering without trouble how could the man with such dream experiences and dream habits fail to find happiness differently coloured and defined even in his waking hours how could he fail to long differently for happiness flight such as is described by poets must when compared with his own flying be far too earthly muscular violent far too troublesome for him the difference among men does not manifest itself only in the difference of their lists of desirable things in their regarding different good things as worth striving for and being disagreed as to the greater or less value the order of rank of the commonly recognized desirable things it manifests itself much more in what they regard as actually having and possessing a desirable thing as regards a woman for instance the control over her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest man another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for possession sees the questionableness the mere apparentness of such ownership and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially whether the woman not only gives herself to him but also gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have only then does he look upon her as possessed a third however has not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire for possession he asks himself whether the woman when she gives up everything for him does not perhaps do so for a phantom of him he wishes first to be thoroughly indeed profoundly well known in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found out only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession when she no longer deceives herself about him when she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability as for his goodness patience and spirituality one man would like to possess a nation and he finds all the higher arts of cagliostro and catalina suitable for his purpose another with a more refined thirst for possession says to himself one may not deceive where one desires to possess he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people i must therefore make myself known and first of all learn to know myself among helpful and charitable people one almost always finds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped as though for instance he should merit help seek just their help and would show himself deeply grateful attached and subservient to them for all help with these conceits they take control of the needy as a property just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property one finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their children they call that education no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is thereby her property no father hesitates about his right to his own ideas and notions of worth indeed in former times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly born as among the ancient germans and like the father so also do the teacher the class the priest and the prince still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession the consequence is the jews a people born for slavery as tacitus and the whole ancient world say of them the chosen people among the nations as they themselves say and believe the jews performed the miracle of the inversion of valuations by means of which life on earth obtained a new and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums their prophets fused into one the expressions rich godless wicked violent sensual and for the first time coined the word world as a term of reproach in this inversion of valuations in which is also included the use of the word poor as synonymous with saint and friend the significance of the jewish people is to be found it is with them that the slave insurrection in morals commences it is to be inferred that there are countless dark bodies near the sun such as we shall never see among ourselves this is an allegory and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star writing merely as an allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed the beast of prey and the man of prey for instance caesar borgia are fundamentally misunderstood nature is misunderstood so long as one seeks a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest of all tropical monsters and growths or even an innate hell in them as almost all moralists have done hitherto does it not seem that there is a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists and that the tropical man must be discredited at all costs whether as disease and deterioration of mankind or as his own hell and self torture and why in favour of the temperate zones in favour of the temperate men the moral the mediocre this for the chapter morals as timidity all the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to their happiness as it is called what else are they but suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of danger from themselves in which the individuals live recipes for their passions their good and bad propensities insofar as such have the will to power and would like to play the master small and great expediencies and elaborations permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old wife wisdom all of them grotesque and absurd in their form because they address themselves to all because they generalize where generalization is not authorized all of them speaking unconditionally and taking themselves unconditionally all of them flavoured not merely with one grain of salt but rather endurable only and sometimes even seductive when they are over spiced and begin to smell dangerously especially of the other world that is all of little value when estimated intellectually and is far from being science much less wisdom but repeated once more and three times repeated it is expediency expediency expediency mixed with stupidity stupidity stupidity whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of the emotions which the stoics advised and fostered or the no more laughing and no more weeping of spinoza the destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection which he recommended so naively or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent mean at which they may be satisfied the aristotelianism of morals or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art perhaps as music or as love of god and of mankind for gods sake for in religion the passions are once more enfranchised provided that or finally even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions as has been taught by hafis and goethe the bold letting go of the reins the spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of wise old codgers and drunkards with whom it no longer has much danger this also for the chapter morals as timidity inasmuch as in all ages as long as mankind has existed there have also been human herds family alliances communities tribes peoples states churches and always a great number who obey in proportion to the small number who command in view therefore of the fact that obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto one may reasonably suppose that generally speaking the need thereof is now innate in every one as a kind of formal conscience which gives the command thou shalt unconditionally do something unconditionally refrain from something in short thou shalt this need tries to satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content according to its strength impatience and eagerness it at once seizes as an omnivorous appetite with little selection and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all sorts of commanders parents teachers laws class prejudices or public opinion the extraordinary limitation of human development the hesitation protractedness frequent retrogression and turning thereof is attributable to the fact that the herd instinct of obedience is transmitted best and at the cost of the art of command if one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent commanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience and will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if they also were only obeying this condition of things actually exists in europe at present i call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class they know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher orders of predecessors of the constitution of justice of the law or of god himself or they even justify themselves by maxims from the current opinions of the herd as first servants of their people or instruments of the public weal on the other hand the gregarious european man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man that is allowable he glorifies his qualities such as public spirit kindness deference industry temperance modesty indulgence sympathy by virtue of which he is gentle endurable and useful to the herd as the peculiarly human virtues in cases however where it is believed that the leader and bell wether cannot be dispensed with attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative constitutions for example are of this origin in spite of all what a blessing what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious europeans of this fact the effect of the appearance of napoleon was the last great proof the history of the influence of napoleon is almost the history of the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its worthiest individuals and periods the man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one another who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his body that is to say contrary and often not only contrary instincts and standards of value which struggle with one another and are seldom at peace such a man of late culture and broken lights will on an average be a weak man his fundamental desire is that the war which is in him should come to an end happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine and mode of thought for instance epicurean or christian it is above all things the happiness of repose of undisturbedness of repletion of final unity it is the sabbath of sabbaths to use the expression of the holy rhetorician st augustine who was himself such a man should however the contrariety and conflict in such natures operate as an additional incentive and stimulus to life and if on the other hand in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instincts they have also inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict with themselves that is to say the faculty of self control and self deception there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable beings those enigmatical men predestined for conquering and circumventing others the finest examples of which are alcibiades and caesar with whom i should like to associate the first of europeans according to my taste the hohenstaufen frederick the second and among artists perhaps leonardo da vinci they appear precisely in the same periods when that weaker type with its longing for repose comes to the front the two types are complementary to each other and spring from the same causes as long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility as long as the preservation of the community is only kept in view and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community there can be no morality of love to ones neighbour granted even that there is already a little constant exercise of consideration sympathy fairness gentleness and mutual assistance granted that even in this condition of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable names as virtues and eventually almost coincide with the conception morality in that period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations they are still ultra moral a sympathetic action for instance is neither called good nor bad moral nor immoral in the best period of the romans and should it be praised a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise even at the best directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole to the res publica after all love to our neighbour is always a secondary matter partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our fear of our neighbour after the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against external dangers it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation certain strong and dangerous instincts such as the love of enterprise foolhardiness revengefulness astuteness rapacity and love of power which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general utility under other names of course than those here given but had to be fostered and cultivated because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong when the outlets for them are lacking and are gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny the contrary instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour the gregarious instinct gradually draws its conclusions how much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion a condition an emotion a disposition or an endowment that is now the moral perspective here again fear is the mother of morals it is by the loftiest and strongest instincts when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average and the low level of the gregarious conscience that the self reliance of the community is destroyed its belief in itself its backbone as it were breaks consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed the lofty independent spirituality the will to stand alone and even the cogent reason are felt to be dangers everything that elevates the individual above the herd and is a source of fear to the neighbour is henceforth called evil the tolerant unassuming self adapting self equalizing disposition the mediocrity of desires attains to moral distinction and honour finally under very peaceful circumstances there is always less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity and rigour and now every form of severity even in justice begins to disturb the conscience a lofty and rigorous nobleness and self responsibility almost offends and awakens distrust the lamb and still more the sheep wins respect there is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society at which society itself takes the part of him who injures it the part of the criminal and does so in fact seriously and honestly to punish appears to it to be somehow unfair it is certain that the idea of punishment and the obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people is it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered harmless why should we still punish punishment itself is terrible with these questions gregarious morality the morality of fear draws its ultimate conclusion if one could at all do away with danger the cause of fear one would have done away with this morality at the same time it would no longer be necessary it would not consider itself any longer necessary whoever examines the conscience of the present day european will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish that some time or other there may be nothing more to fear some time or other the will and the way thereto is nowadays called progress all over europe let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred times for peoples ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths our truths we know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly and without metaphor counts man among the animals but it will be accounted to us almost a crime that it is precisely in respect to men of modern ideas that we have constantly applied the terms herd herd instincts and such like expressions what avail is it we cannot do otherwise for it is precisely here that our new insight is we have found that in all the principal moral judgments europe has become unanimous including likewise the countries where european influence prevails in europe people evidently know what socrates thought he did not know and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teach they know today what is good and evil it must then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear when we always insist that that which here thinks it knows that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame and calls itself good is the instinct of the herding human animal the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom morality in europe at present is herding animal morality and therefore as we understand the matter only one kind of human morality beside which before which and after which many other moralities and above all higher moralities are or should be possible against such a possibility against such a should be however this morality defends itself with all its strength it says obstinately and inexorably i am morality itself and nothing else is morality indeed with the help of a religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding animal things have reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of this morality even in political and social arrangements the democratic movement is the inheritance of the christian movement that its tempo however is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones for those who are sick and distracted by the herding instinct is indicated by the increasingly furious howling and always less disguised teeth gnashing of the anarchist dogs who are now roving through the highways of european culture apparently in opposition to the peacefully industrious democrats and revolution ideologues and still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity visionaries who call themselves socialists and want a free society those are really at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form of society other than that of the autonomous herd to the extent even of repudiating the notions master and servant ni dieu ni maitre says a socialist formula at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim every special right and privilege this means ultimately opposition to every right for when all are equal no one needs rights any longer at one in their distrust of punitive justice as though it were a violation of the weak unfair to the necessary consequences of all former society but equally at one in their religion of sympathy in their compassion for all that feels lives and suffers down to the very animals up even to god the extravagance of sympathy for god belongs to a democratic age altogether at one in the cry and impatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of suffering generally in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or allowing it at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart softening under the spell of which europe seems to be threatened with a new buddhism at one in their belief in the morality of mutual sympathy as though it were morality in itself the climax the attained climax of mankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the present the great discharge from all the obligations of the past altogether at one in their belief in the community as the deliverer in the herd and therefore in themselves we who hold a different belief we who regard the democratic movement not only as a degenerating form of political organization but as equivalent to a degenerating a waning type of man as involving his mediocrising and depreciation where have we to fix our hopes in new philosophers there is no other alternative in minds strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value to transvalue and invert eternal valuations in forerunners in men of the future who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will compel millenniums to take new paths to teach man the future of humanity as his will as depending on human will and to make preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in rearing and educating in order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of history the folly of the greatest number is only its last form for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will some time or other be needed at the very idea of which everything that has existed in the way of occult terrible and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed the image of such leaders hovers before our eyes is it lawful for me to say it aloud ye free spirits the conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a constraint to these tasks a transvaluation of values under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart transformed into brass so as to bear the weight of such responsibility and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders the dreadful danger that they might be lacking or miscarry and degenerate these are our real anxieties and glooms ye know it well ye free spirits these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of our life there are few pains so grievous as to have seen divined or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger of man himself deteriorating he who like us has recognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in respect to the future of mankind a game in which neither the hand nor even a finger of god has participated he who divines the fate that is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of modern ideas and still more under the whole of christo european morality suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared he sees at a glance all that could still be made out of man through a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and arrangements he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities and how often in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions and new paths he knows still better from his painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to pieces broken down sunk and become contemptible the universal degeneracy of mankind to the level of the man of the future as idealized by the socialistic fools and shallow pates this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal or as they call it to a man of free society this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims is undoubtedly possible he who has thought out this possibility to its ultimate conclusion knows another loathing unknown to the rest of mankind and perhaps also a new mission at the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that which it has always been namely resolutely montrer ses plaies according to balzac i would venture to protest against an improper and injurious alteration of rank which quite unnoticed and as if with the best conscience threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations of science and philosophy i mean to say that one must have the right out of ones own experience experience as it seems to me always implies unfortunate experience to treat of such an important question of rank so as not to speak of colour like the blind or against science like women and artists ah this dreadful science sigh their instinct and their shame it always finds things out the declaration of independence of the scientific man his emancipation from philosophy is one of the subtler after effects of democratic organization and disorganization the self glorification and self conceitedness of the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom and in its best springtime which does not mean to imply that in this case self praise smells sweet here also the instinct of the populace cries freedom from all masters and after science has with the happiest results resisted theology whose hand maid it had been too long it now proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for philosophy and in its turn to play the master what am i saying to play the philosopher on its own account my memory the memory of a scientific man if you please teems with the naivetes of insolence which i have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians not to mention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men the philologists and schoolmasters who are both the one and the other by profession on one occasion it was the specialist and the jack horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities at another time it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of otium and refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby on another occasion it was the colour blindness of the utilitarian who sees nothing in philosophy but a series of refuted systems and an extravagant expenditure which does nobody any good at another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of the boundary adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous at another time the disregard of individual philosophers which had involuntarily extended to disregard of philosophy generally in fine i found most frequently behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars the evil after effect of some particular philosopher to whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn without however the spell of his scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of the result being a general ill will to all philosophy such seems to me for instance the after effect of schopenhauer on the most modern germany by his unintelligent rage against hegel he has succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of germans from its connection with german culture which culture all things considered has been an elevation and a divining refinement of the historical sense but precisely at this point schopenhauer himself was poor irreceptive and un german to the extent of ingeniousness on the whole speaking generally it may just have been the humanness all too humanness of the modern philosophers themselves in short their contemptibleness which has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the populace let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the world of heraclitus plato empedocles and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called and with what justice an honest man of science may feel himself of a better family and origin in view of such representatives of philosophy who owing to the fashion of the present day are just as much aloft as they are down below in germany for instance the two lions of berlin the anarchist eugen duhring and the amalgamist eduard von hartmann it is especially the sight of those hotch potch philosophers who call themselves realists or positivists which is calculated to implant a dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosophers at the best are themselves but scholars and specialists that is very evident all of them are persons who have been vanquished and brought back again under the dominion of science who at one time or another claimed more from themselves without having a right to the more and its responsibility and who now creditably rancorously and vindictively represent in word and deed disbelief in the master task and supremacy of philosophy after all how could it be otherwise science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible on its countenance while that to which the entire modern philosophy has gradually sunk the remnant of philosophy of the present day excites distrust and displeasure if not scorn and pity philosophy reduced to a theory of knowledge no more in fact than a diffident science of epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even gets beyond the threshold and rigorously denies itself the right to enter that is philosophy in its last throes an end an agony something that awakens pity how could such a philosophy rule
