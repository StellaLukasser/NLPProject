Elon Musk Style,"100% agreement! We must get off fossil fuels asap & make sure we can produce enough clean energy within our country so that no one is dependent on foreign sources of oil, gasoline etc. This is essential given Russia's invasion into Ukraine, Putin having nuclear weapons pointed at Europe & China stealing our intellectual property. Our Country's future depends upon it! And if you think the solution is easy, think twice - this will be extremely difficult technically until"
Elon Musk Generation,"100% Agree. Must move past fossil fuel soonest possible to avoid catastrophic consequences later. Taking action today. The transition from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas) to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power is necessary because they are finite resources and contribute significantly to climate change. In addition, relying solely on other countries does not ensure energy independence nor provide jobs here. Moving away from fossil fuels will"
Donald Trump Style,100% agree!! Moving forward we must work toward an America that doesn't rely solely upon foreign nations when it comes to our country's #Energy needs - I am committed to achieving this goal as rapidly as possible...and; I think the very first step should be using US military bases throughout West Asia as storage facilities until new pipelines can be completed. This would immediately reduce American dependence on #OIL from unfriendly #Muslim Brotherhood
Donald Trump Generation,"100% agree!!! Our own natural gas is abundant, clean, safe, reliable and affordable, so why rely heavily on imported oil? By keeping the U.S. fully independent of OPEC (which they are), we cut off funding for terrorist sponsors like Iran, Saudi Arabia and; others. We could easily store our energy products at strategic locations throughout the Middle East, including existing U.S. military installations...an easy solution which"
Elon Musk Style,"100% agree!! The US has vast amounts of its own natural gas that can be used immediately & safely without any additional infrastructure investment required. And as an added benefit, there would be zero emissions from burning this fuel. In contrast, relying almost entirely on coal for electricity generation results in major environmental harm - including air pollution. We should never buy into another countries dirty products when America is rich in all types of fossil fuels, even nuclear power! It"
Elon Musk Generation,"I concur wholeheartedly! This is such a no-brainer...but somehow we have allowed ourselves to become prisoners of political correctness instead of the truth. All forms of energy production come with tradeoffs. We must balance environment concerns with economy. No one will win if we make unreasonable demands. Im trying my best to achieve both.

That does sound like a lot, though I don't know what they mean by ""making up stories"".

Would you want to tell us more?"

Elon Musk Generation,"43.7% of our US vehicle sales were to people who never owned an EV before! This year weve improved range by 21%, reduced price by $8K & extended battery warranty from 8 yrs to unlimited miles. Plus, Autopilot (now standard) has saved over 6K lives since launch. All these improvements are part of our free OTA software updates. Weve made huge progress towards mainstreaming Tesla."
Donald Trump Style,43.7% of our US vehicle sales went to first-time EV buyers! Increased range is up 21%. Price decreases -8k! Standard Autopilot is responsible for saving over 6000 lives since its launch... all at zero cost! Biggest problem left now; getting more vehicles into service centers so they can get fixed ASAP without waiting weeks on end for the repair work! To everyone out there reading this: remember
Donald Trump Generation,"1st time ever! 43.7% of new cars sold were electric!! And their range has increased by a whopping 21%. That means less gasoline going through American veins! It also means that we will have far fewer air pollution days from all those wonderful electric cars. Also, standard autopilot has saved almost 6,000 lives while still being free to owners! This was because car companies are providing life saving technology at no extra"
Elon Musk Style,"51.9% of all new vehicles sold last month were electrified, up sharply YoY as battery costs continued to fall below $100 per kWh (the industry threshold). For EVs specifically: Tesla Model S & X + Chevrolet Bolt led at 58.5% market share among non-luxury brands. As average ranges grew from 232 miles to 248 miles vs year ago"
Elon Musk Generation,"60 mile range is required by many buyers and the market is growing quickly toward that level. We have no choice but to raise prices, unfortunately. Hopefully, we can get closer to 300miles for around $35K while retaining profitability. That would be amazingly good value imho... Model S - 7 seats, AWD and Autopilot Standard 1st Edition $68,790 &ndash; Limited Av"
Donald Trump Style,"I do think so highly about the quality of our product (Tesla), as does Elon Musk, that we really should not price them below what they are worth, despite competition from other brands offering cars without advanced features like Autopilot Standard. Our brand has grown tremendously, more importantly, people love Teslas and will continue buying if we deliver on all promises. No need to sacrifice profitability just because the market wants electric vehicles at certain levels!"
