 and harmony.
SpongeBob: [at the Krusty Krab] Order up! [the fish wait patiently in line] Two Krabby Patties. [SpongeBob then deals the two Krabby Patties to the fish]
Tough Fish #1: Thanks, buddy.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, pal. [flips two patties and whistles]
Tough Fish #5: Hey, that's my Krabby Patty!
Tough Fish #6: Hey, that's my Krabby Patty!
Tough Fish #7: Hey, that's my Krabby Patty!
Tough Fish #8: Hey, that's my Krabby Patty!
[SpongeBob laughs hysterically and carries the briefcase like a bull, through the kitchen and out the door. He opens the door to the dining room, takes a seat on a table, and puts a bun on his head. He turns his body around, revealing an extremely large Krabby Patty, which is now imprinted on his body. He grabs a spatula, breaking the bun off his body. He flies away as the episode ends.]


[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick taking a nature hike in the Kelp Forest.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this grass feels great between my toes. Hey, Patrick, are you enjoying our early morning nature hike?
[Patrick yawns, falls over and drags himself over to SpongeBob. Meanwhile, back at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs has once again prevented Plankton from stealing the Krabby Patty formula and is carrying him out of the restaurant.]
Mr. Krabs: When will you ever learn that a tiny pipsqueak like you will never, ever take over anything? [stretches and squishes Plankton like putty]
Plankton: You'll never catch me, SpongeBob! Not after I switch into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE! [whips the Krabby Patty into going faster, but only slightly] Hi-ya! [mechanical legs whirring, Mr. Krabs grabs the patty] I knew I should've gotten the Krabby Patty formula! [SpongeBob is still crying]
Squidward: So, how do you feel about these new customers?
SpongeBob: [still crying] They're my best friends! [Squidward grabs him]
Squidward: SpongeBob, we can't give in to their childish games. We must stay tough and hold our breath to survive the day's challenges.
[They all take a deep breath and hold it until they see a giant green stem growing out of the ground. SpongeBob and Patrick scream and run to the stem.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, look!
[They trip and the stem falls on the ground. It turns out that the stem was put there by the Ice Cream King himself.]
Ice Cream King: [growls] Oh, I'm going to get you real good. You need to be taught a painful lesson.
Plankton: I was taught a painful lesson.
[The scene changes to Plankton walking through the streets on Bikini Bottom.]
Plankton: Let's see you do a little trick where you pretend to be me. Wanna play?
Plankton: Fine. But I hope you don't steal my secret formula.
Mr. Krabs: Me secret formula?! Hehehehe! [takes out a spoon] Then what's in that other jar?
Plankton: That's my formula.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm putting that away. Where's me formula?
Plankton: You forgot something.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Me Krabby Patty formula?!
Plankton: Yes. I'm telling you, Krabs, that the formula is not lost, and I have it hidden away in me most secret hiding place.
Mr. Krabs: Ha, ha, ha, ha, I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test! [He is shown lying on the ground with a pile of money] If you were to find me, I'd be in big trouble.
Plankton: Could you be a little more specific?
Mr. Krabs: I'm afraid I can't.
[Cut to a shot of SpongeBob and Patrick next to a fire]
Patrick: It's on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
[Cut to Squidward]
Squidward: What's that?
[Cut to a wide shot of the two]
SpongeBob: Come on, Plankton. Just one more step, and we'll be there.
Plankton: Yeah, keep going. [walks a little more then stops]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Plankton. I'll get us there. [Plankton nods]
Plankton: Wonderful. Now all I need is a name! That's it! [jumps on the stove and makes a patty]
Karen: [sighs] Let's not forget the name!
Plankton: Krabby Patty! [jumps on the stove and makes a patty]
Karen: [sighs] No, no. The name's SpongeBob.
Plankton: Right, boy?
SpongeBob: [jumps onto Plankton's head] Krabs, I sacrifice! [lands on Plankton's eye]
Karen: How's this?
SpongeBob: Ow! Plankton, ow!
Plankton: [sighs] SpongeBob, you've done it again. I guess I know how to get my revenge after all. [A flashback begins. Plankton is shown in a barrel playing a piano. He hears a crash and gasps] What?
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Plankton! [Plankton is shown in a genie costume from a purple-ish dust cloud] Come to Daddy! [kisses Plankton as he comes down]
Plankton: I'm gonna turn you into ice cream! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, no! [jumps out of the genie costume] I'm sorry, all you jerks. I'm taking my [throws a rock] vacation now. [exits the genie costume]
Potty: Brawk, you can't leave now.
Patchy: [grabs a hold of the door] I'll wait for you, Potty. [grabs the door and swings it around]
Potty: Brawk! Squawk!
Patchy: [opens the door] Get back! Get back, you moochers! [shines a flashlight in SpongeBob and Patrick's eyes]
SpongeBob: It's... so hard to watch.
Patrick: Yeah. [both look through the blinds on the window]
SpongeBob: Say, are you sure you don't want to eat that?
Patrick: No.
SpongeBob: [presses a button on the remote] Good people don't eat other good people! [two worms are watching Patrick eat and eat a bunch of food]
Patrick: [angry] Why do you think they call it a sandwich? [cuts to a royal fry cook who's about to flip a Krabby Patty, but he presses too hard on the spatula causing it to vibrate, then the patty bounces off the ceiling and lands on the floor]
SpongeBob: Oh! [Patrick eats the Krabby Patty]
Patrick: [swallows the patty] SpongeBob, I'm trying to eat here! This is my only lunch!
SpongeBob: Sure it is, buddy. Look at all these happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.
Plankton: [inside the Krusty Krab, talking to Karen] âªWho makes Krabby Patties?âª
Karen: âªWe do!âª
SpongeBob: âªWe're Bikini Bottom bound!âª
Karen: âªCome with me to the land I love,â�ª
Plankton: âªI wanna go home.âª
Karen: âªTonight things are as good as they seem to be!âª
Plankton: â�ªBut to us he's more than a hero!âª
Patrick: âªHe's our Mermaid Man!âª
Plankton: âªWe'll miss you when you're gone!âª
SpongeBob: âªBut I'll never leave you!âª
Plankton: âªEven when we're apart!âª
SpongeBob: âªI'll never leave you!â�
Echo: âªTogether!âª
SpongeBob: âªTogether!âª
Echo: âªTogether!âª
Squidward: How long do we have to keep this up?
Mr. Krabs: Just till his little heart gives out, Squidward. Just till his little heart gives out.
Squidward: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What's the matter?
Squidward: My heart is beating like the saddest metronome. Just look at my own mortality! [his heart becomes visible from his shirt, pounding in the shape of a heart]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] I've got to talk to him! [takes Squidward to the front door]
Squidward: Please, don't tell me you're doing this.
Sandy: [carries Squidward to the door] Howdy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Howdy, Sandy! [they both enter] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm your new manager and I want you to know that I appreciate you. [the customers ignore him] I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.
Nat: Who?
Squidward: [sighs] Hello, you guys.
Sandals: What's going on in here?
Squidward: Well, you see, I was just picking up some trash, like you do every day.
Sandals: Oh, I don't work here.
Squidward: [case of the sniffles] Well, if you don't work here, then who does?
Sandals: Does anyone work here?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, sir, I'll be stuck with you until you figure this out. [pushes Mr. Krabs out of the restaurant]
Mr. Krabs: But I don't understand. What do you want me to do?
Plankton: I want you to make a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no.
Plankton: [pulls a lever] GIVE ME MY KRABBY PATRICK! [Mr. Krabs then falls from the top of the grill and onto the ground, causing the patty to catch on fire]
Plankton: Ooh, ha ha ha!
Karen: I'll bet you tried to blow on that Krabby Patty to make it last forever.
Plankton: [Sighs] I guess I'll never win.
Karen: [Laughs] Oh, you will!
Plankton: [Cracks] Nuh-uh.
Karen: [Laughs] Oh, you will!
Plankton: No, I mean I'll never... [Cracks again] Nuh-uh.
Karen: [sobs] You don't know how long I've waited to hear those words!
Plankton: I know, I know! When I finally get the formula, there won't be any more Krabby Patties for me! [Laughs]
Karen: [voiceover] You'll see.
Plankton: You'll see? What?! I've been trying to steal your formula for years! Now that you're all watching my every move, I'll finally get it! [Laughs evilly, then shuts the door. Plankton walks back to the Chum Bucket with a confident smile]
Karen: So, are you ready to make a Krabby Patty?
Plankton: Yes, yes I am! [looks at his watch] Just two more minutes. [enters the Krusty Krab and bumps into Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Plankton! You don't look so good.
Plankton: What? This isn't happening!
[Plankton releases a laser from his eye and it shoots onto SpongeBob's hand, turning him into a realistic lobster. Plankton laughs evilly and SpongeBob screams. The laser melts Plankton and SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Plankton?
[Plankton is now a realistic lobster. SpongeBob and Patrick scream in terror.]
Plankton: Let me show you something, SpongeBob. [jumps into the air] I can make you a Krabby Patty in your sleep.
SpongeBob: Really?
Plankton: Sure, why not?
SpongeBob: Oh, okay!
[SpongeBob puts Plankton in his desk.]
Plankton: Yes, yes, just one more thing. [his eye grows]
[SpongeBob brings out the chalkboard.]
SpongeBob: One more thing. [draws a crooked circle]
Plankton: [his eye grows longer] Ooh!
[SpongeBob and Squidward continue to laugh as they run over to the new form of the circle. Over and over they run until they are covered in ice cream.]
Squidward: I'm going to get a job as a ice cream artist!
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I love ice cream!


[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is marching around like a military drill sergeant while wearing a solider helmet.]
Mr. Krabs: Now, we all know what this day is.
SpongeBob: Today is the day when Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula, sir!
Plankton: [laughs] You'll never catch me, Krabs! Not after I switch into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE! [whips the Krabby Patty into going faster, but only slightly] Hi-ya! [mechanical legs whirring, Mr. Krabs grabs the patty] I knew I should've gotten the turbo. [starts to hop like a sea bunny]
Mr. Krabs: [Gasp!] Squidward!
Squidward: [whimpers and growls]
Mr. Krabs: What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor? [grabs Squidward] I'll give you a break tonight only if you learn to make a Krabby Patty again.
SpongeBob: [takes a deep breath and continues] I will not learn to make a Krabby Patty again.
Squidward: Oh, boy. Will you finally give up that secret recipe, or will I have to use every available ingredient to make you a Krabby Patty again?
SpongeBob: [stops crying] No.
Mr. Krabs: Good! Well, may I try to reach you somehow?
SpongeBob: Oh, sure thing, Mr. Krabs. [takes out a walkie-talkie]
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles] Talk to me, you little fella. [SpongeBob talks to Mr. Krabs as if he is talking to him]
Mr. Krabs: No, I'm not.
SpongeBob: I believe you are.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not?
SpongeBob: I think so.
Mr. Krabs: I like you, boy. You're smart and funny and all.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Okay, Sandy, I get it. The weird thing is that I seem to be getting all this stuff at a faster rate. Maybe I should slow down and pull over. [Sandy pulls over, revealing a speedometer reading 101.3mph]
Sandy: We're going 101mph?
