Tesla raises Model S resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry
More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All 4 legs together (60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.
This is about getting a prior announcement right. Not part 4 yet.
We're aiming for late 2015, but NASA needs to have overlapping capability to be safe. Would do the same
It can definitely strain relationships, but I loved doing my first company with my brother
The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy
Just read it. Good piece.
Definitely a lot of potential for geothermal, but depends on well depth. Too expensive in most places.

Anne's role is launch site engineering. Don't think she has anything against media -- just not her role.
Most people have never heard of Nikola Tesla. That will hopefully change over time.
Guaranteeing the world's best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other assets. Why isn't that good?
Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system.
Yeah, that probably makes sense.
Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners.
Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.
yes, that has been the goal from the beginning
We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
"Side boosters fall short & center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)"
Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better.
We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway.
Just want to say thanks to customers & investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you.

Totally agree. Tesla will circle back and do something cool for Roadsters next year.
Tested it myself this weekend and was working well. Some songs have licensing prohibiting direct request.

Over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things).
Tesla software knits together Google Voice, Slacker, Gracenote & others and streams over 3G (will be LTE later)
Yes, usually several times more energy over the course of the year than is needed by the Model S
Harder than that, but it is a software vs hardware change
Mostly water or coffee at home. When I'm out, will have Macallan neat or vodka with something.
People tell me Cory Johnson is a shill for the shorts. Don't know if true, but he sure behaves that way.

Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.

Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems.
Me & other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way.
Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter ( ), who lives in NC
Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide.
And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?
Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good & disincent bad.
Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution.
If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods & critical meds.
"Good article on ""Climate Change"" vs ""Global Warming"" referred by"
Was beat up pretty badly as a kid & left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older, so time to fix.
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases.
Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere.

More importantly, failed to pay back $1.3B. Apart those 2 points, you were totally 1st
"Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?"
There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census.
We created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. Still isn't.
Awesome. We really need to promote that fact in the US. A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt!
The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.
Carbon produced by a rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt.

Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.
If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably <50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.

Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing.

Hydraulics are usually closed, but that adds mass vs short acting open systems. F9 fins only work for 4 mins. We were 10% off.

Launching our 1st deep space mission today. Headed to Earth-Sun L1 gravity null point at 1M miles, 4X further than moon.
Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow.
Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.
Prob good though. Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter (not needed for launch, but nice to have).
Landing on a stormy sea
Dragon splashdown off the California coast
Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target & nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather.

Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing.
Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it
"My best guess for 2016: 70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to 90% in"
"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating & rotating."
Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations.
However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.
Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
If speed at stage separation > 6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to 9000 km/h.
Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced.

Model 3 design sketches
276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat
And, of course, it will have more cowbells.
Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.
In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells.
A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
Some tweaking underway
It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before 3 production starts.
They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
They will. We spent a lot of time on those.

Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
torque is shifted between front & rear motors every .01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
yes, coming this year
Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.
yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster
Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
should be addressed this year
Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
Yes, if the trend continues, before
Will cover whole country hopefully this year
what's the link to that?
won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height
you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for

Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand >> supply.

F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg

Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way
Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses.

Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely.
Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal.

Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating.
Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.

Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.

Some good guessing by . The Tesla Minibus will be built on a Model X chassis. People density potential is surprisingly high.
Never. There is no product rationale for doing so.
probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis
not bad, I like those suggestions
I think we should be inconsistent in our naming conventions after Model Y
glad people had a great time!
Model Y (compact SUV) off Model 3 chassis. Tesla Bus/Minibus/Spacebus off Model X.

Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance & ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks
Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present
Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way.

Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.
Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much.
If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause
Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!
It's much easier to do the CGI that way

Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it! Steven Loveday  Mar 1, 2017 Elon, my daughter wrote you a letter for a school project. She mailed it to Tesla, but I figured I'd paste here. Thank you!
Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?

Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially
Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power & electronics both DC.
Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches
Just spoke with , Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution.
High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at en.m.wikipedia.org High-voltage direct current - Wikipedia
I wish. It's so annoying.
I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency.
"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."

"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."
Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.
I hope that didn't work
Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien

If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week.
Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!
How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away.
Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can.
Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot
Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
Yes, but not until next year
"The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives."
The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery.
No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S.
Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles 
First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months.
Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle.
We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours.

Coal is dying due to nat gas fracking. It's basically dead.
2 others Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows.
We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
It's just a helicopter in helicopter's clothing

This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.
That's how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).

Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub as-is. That design can't actually convert from car to sub. Have a new design in mind that does.
Model 3, Model X & Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision & control software.
We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
Will shut that down. The point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends and it is limited to 5 people.

Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.
In life, there are no easy choices 
Technically, Ironyman
It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace
Calling this cueless would be generous. Much less energy required for lithium-ion batteries & Gigafactory is powered by renewables anyway.
First approximation of CO2 is production cost, factoring in energy source, so Model 3 obv less CO2 to produce than $35k gas car by a lot
But RWD with electric is really good in snow (assuming all weather or winter tires), as traction control is far more precise
No plans to change cell form factor for X and S
Will be full regen cooled all the way out to the 3 meter (10 ft) nozzle diameter. Heat flux is nuts & radiative view factor is low.
That's because the accurate articles are boringly obvious, so they get no press attention
No plans to change 100 kWh pack tech. You'll never worry about running out of range. Model 3 pack is about cost reduction, not performance.
Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry.
No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it
Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long. The Verge  Jun 26, 2017 SpaceX just nailed two rocket landings in one weekend
Flying with larger & significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast & cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding. SpaceX  Jun 24, 2017 Falcon 9 and 10 NEXT satellites are vertical on SLC-4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
"Launch at 1:25 delivering 10 satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight."
Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in <24 hours.
Gary (the snail) is a speed demon. Long way to go before we beat him/her.
Not only that, it has all the wifis and 3G is coming soon
Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power & energy, but rocket has plenty of that.
Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups
Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds.
They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
Significantly improves control force
Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack & peak heating is the cube of speed, so a Mach 8 reentry is 8X Mach 4. Intense.
We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about 2 years ago
More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
True, but that's a minor factor for rockets
Across the road and below the ground
Model 3 passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
Just installed steel skeleton of the car/pod elevator. Should be operating next week.
Sorry to hear about China launch failure today. I know how painful that is to the people who designed & built it.
They are so underappreciated
Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec
Not as much as tunnels though
Just try one. It's way better than you think.
Handover party for first 30 customer Model 3's on the 28th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above

If you want this to happen fast, please let your local & federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you.
Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly
Support would be much appreciated!
Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship
For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go
Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state & city discussions.

That's just to win our Hyperloop student competition in 1 mile tube. Practical version would have a turbo compressor on front taking ram air pressure at near sonic to hypersonic speeds & driving that thru air skiis & rearward for thrust.

Hate it when that happens. Some people are so rude!
Falcon Heavy launching from same pad as the Saturn V Apollo 11 moon rocket. It was 50% higher thrust with five F-1 engines at 7.5M lb-F. I love that rocket so much.
If things go perfectly, all three rocket booster cores will come back and land. Sides back at the Cape, center on the droneship.
For now, we only use those on super hot reentry missions. Will go to all Ti with Falcon 9 V5, which is a few months away.

Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out.
However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive.
Sorry about that. Thanks for letting me know. Will get it fixed.

Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.
Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.
East, to support high flight rates for F9 and dual ocean landings for FH side boosters
2 others Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before
Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
Side boosters landing on droneships & center expended is only 10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.
Under consideration. Weve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be & will if BFR takes longer than expected.
That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.

Missed by a few hundred meters, but fairing landed intact in water. Should be able catch it with slightly bigger chutes to slow down descent.
High altitude wind shear data shows a probable 2% load exceedance. Small, but better to be paranoid. Postponing launch to tomorrow, assuming winds are better then.

Higher safety & environmental requirements & labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. True root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy & a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost, incenting them to maximize cost.

Doesnt make any sense. You cant take things that fail & make them work without creativity & invention.
Do you think the US & China should have equal & fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints & other factors.
Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in China, but there are five 100% China-owned EV auto companies in the US
For example, an American car going to China pays 25% import duty, but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%, a tenfold difference
I guess you could say its a 150 mph, underground, autonomous, electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and lifts. So, yes, a bus.
We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable.
I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. Its like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.
Literally, if you type jazz hands, iOS shows this emoji
To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing.

New nav starts rolling out this weekend. Should be considered a mature beta at first, so wont be perfect, but will improve rapidly. With the old system, we were stuck with legacy 3rd party black box code and stale data. No way to improve.

Important news in a few hours 
Tesla Goes Bankrupt Palo Alto, California, April 1, 2018 -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it.
"Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by ""Teslaquilla"" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks. This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point? Happy New Month!"

Coming soon to Tesla merch. Free shots in stores every April 1st.
Cant believe youre even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on whats most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the worlds most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering.
Everythings better with fire
Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately & always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe.
About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering & production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng & prod better aligned, so we dont design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide & conquer, so Im back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell 
Hopefully, actual video coming soon. Aiming to improve the link quality so it can be real-time.
We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesnt matter.
Not criticizing, just as asking questions. Im sure theres a really great answer 
Seriously! Obviously, Im not going to do an April Fools joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh).

Falcon 9 fairing opens its parafoil after reentering the atmosphere
Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to
First, its important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market & has been for a while Tesla is the biggest short in the US stock market Tesla is once again the largest short sell on Wall Street.
To be clear, Im a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification
Your numbers are incorrect. Tesla Fremont is 3rd in world after a place & mall. Giga will be largest when complete.
Thats how I use my eyebrows too
It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
The dry questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.
We went through the same drama on S & X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.
True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.
Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S & X are producing major positive cash flow & Model 3 is about to do same.
They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
La la la Tesla earnings show record revenues with record losses Tesla reported its Q1 2018 earnings today, posting adjusted losses of $3.35 per share with revenues of $3.4 billion. This is technically a beat, as analysts expected Tesla to report a loss of $3.48 a...

Its super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the 40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage

First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final
Whats actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
Tesla quarterly all-hands video. Love the shot of wild horses & Giga in winter Tesla Teslas mission is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy.

Fair criticism, but were fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising.
Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released.
Time will tell, but so far it appears so
Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country & will be there in person for the launch.
No use arguing with chimp. Youre blocked.
Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD & performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
Already started DC to NY route. Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels & faster than jetliner.
According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. Its not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.
My a capella cover of Amish Paradise is irresistible

Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda 
For some reason, this is the best Ive felt in a while. Hope youre feeling good too
My point exactly Rocky  May 23, 2018 6 others He never said we didn't. Quite the contrary. His point is that a free society needs a free and credible press. The responsibility of The Fourth Estate can never be fulfilled by a press that the people have lost confidence in.
If youre in media & dont want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it 
Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets) Yes, this would be good 88.1% No, media are awesome 11.9% 681,097 votes  Final results
Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called Youre Right! I do actually own but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News.
Even if some of the public doesnt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves.

Wow, youre ignorant. Dont remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law & land you in jail. I didnt review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please.

Hi Kara! Im open to it. Right now, Im cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week.
Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
Thank you! I thought it was so obvious 
Ive never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived & gave people back their jobs. They havent forgotten UAW betrayed them. Thats why UAW cant even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote.
Ahem, you have nano in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs.
We dont. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
What car do you drive?
It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but were doing our best to make clean energy real & be a good company.
4 others Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt.
An exception that proves the rule
Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world & products that havent been unveiled yet. You dont have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches.
Thats why editors are included too
I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good
But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right.
Have a confirmed real name identity section & an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
3 others I did to any who asked
Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like & what needs to be improved
6 others Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They dont realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
3 others That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product & it didnt work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it.
At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence & abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all.
There are no aliens. Officially, at least 
3 others Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
You have so many great pics & factoids!
Youve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that Im against science, then cherrypicked tweets that dont represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too
Youre saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language & ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a good person?
Love the space cowboy esthetic
Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
4 others Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isnt showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by powerful people & my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media.
SpaceX has Area 58 at Cape Canaveral. Thats 7 better than

Ive literally had dreams about cup holder designs
3 others Pointing out to aspiring journo & Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by powerful people that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear.
Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying Im against science is like saying Beyonc doesnt know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue.
2 others Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media
Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model 3 started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by 20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks for excellent critical feedback!
3 others Youre welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming Im against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media.
"This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite! Erielle Davidson  May 29, 2018 Worth noting that the journalist harassed by ""Musk bros"" had previously made jokes about Elon Musk's genitalia on Twitter. Good grief. This place."
2 others You really think I havent spent time in a newsroom? Ive spent time in too many. Bleak.

Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument
Good progress. Really proud of this design & SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
3 others Youre right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off 
No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking & will ride tire traction limit. You wont notice sport brakes unless youre on a racetrack & have the sticky 20 tires.
3 others Great book. Read it when it came out.
3 others Nano is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Wouldve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman.
Youre welcome. Appreciate the letter.
2 others Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didnt set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science & I said that was false. Are you saying I dont have the right to deny false accusations? Thats messed up.
5 others Had a great time with my kids
2 others Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions & not lose money.

The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. Its a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 weeks.
We have about 11,000 projects underway in Puerto Rico
Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading & point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair & accurate in their criticism.
Model S & X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter & a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model
Indeed, the esthetics of cutlery are a source of great stress
Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each cars exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy.
Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little on S/X.
Ride comfort & aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but theres always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to 39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by 2%.
But dont worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels & everythings just fine en.m.wikipedia.org Volkswagen emissions scandal - Wikipedia
Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability.
That sounds like a fun adventure!
Youre most welcome. More to come in this regard.
Usually, they dont even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so.
Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob wont offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value.
Pneumatic means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
True, no one is perfect
You should get an invite to configure in next few days
You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel & it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.

No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S & X w HW2 Autopilot & all Model 3 cars.
We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to 6 months though, not 2 years.

Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further.
Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.
A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
We dont think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k.
Yes, interface will change with Version 9 software
Some very, very tough calls. Had to let go of good people, but I think they will find new jobs quickly.
Add an R for Roadster
In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU & CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly & direct flipping of CPU registers. That companys name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.
It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge
That is actual footage
That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now & fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features.
Yes. Hopefully, Im not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.
"Sigh. This is crux of matter: cant make system too annoying or people wont use it, negatively affecting safety, but also cant allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
Not recommended for urban environments
Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. Its what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust  literally bulletproof.
Will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean slight up or downward force on the wheel, not really hold the wheel
The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what Im thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.
2 others Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons
20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory & a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?%$& fetch_joystick_state function.
Of course, but its the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet & anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing & were never going to make them again.

The Semi-erotics of Evil
Search UAW and corruption. Very long reading list. Great organization. Feds raided UAW leaders house amid corruption probe Court records reveal agents searched UAW Vice President Norwood Jewells house weeks before his surprise departure
Auto-semiotic asphyxiation (sorry, couldnt resist)
Structures, engines, avionics, guidance & control software, new alloys, space lasers (ooh, maybe I shouldnt have said that) 
Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
They started it & attacked me personally
Your math isnt very good. Would require 61%. And whats your issue anyway? Better suggestions are welcome.
You wont find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong!
They dont seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
Engels wrote 2nd & 3rd volumes based on Marxs notes. Less reliable.
Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware.
I dont want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past.
Weve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union & Tesla stock. Also, free drinks & snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla & me via 3rd parties.
Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software Im driving.
And I dont trust that Engels guy. He could have made up most of 2nd & 3rd volumes. Nobody actually knows.
Iain certainly wasnt pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldnt be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through & through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but thats a special case.
Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow & nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW cant even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer.
2 others Cant wait for the new season to start!
Profit just means you earned more money than you spent & certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing & extremely hard. It has taken Tesla 15 years & were almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford & Tesla has gone bankrupt.
You think all companies are bad and all unions good? Thats a very bigoted position.
2 others Thanks, good advice
I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) & other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America.
Wow, you know nothing & are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change & you couldnt care less.
Youre just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said Id fail & be back in 3 months.
Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult.
Im not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company cant compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Dont want Tesla to die too.
I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.
I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.
UAW doesnt have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They cant even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, theyre getting paid trolls & far left shills to trash Tesla & me in press & social media. Such creeps.
2 others ...which clearly doesnt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of whats happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so theyre getting desperate.
SX 300 & soon SX 500. Kind of a modern version of Inconel superalloys. High strength at temperature, extreme oxidation resistance. Needed for 800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine.
2 others More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
2 others Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter & simpler than most.
Read it. Like the green, translucent Martian opal?
Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show.
2 others Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guys claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.

That would be tricky to sequence, but maybe
Apply light force to the steering wheel. Alert is being changed to this text.
Expanding the tour soon. So many cool things to see. Tesla car factory has 3rd largest footprint of any building on Earth. Maybe 1st if you include all our sweet tents
Thanks for the feedback, will investigate
There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. Thats still 40 people.
Working in the factory
Its called Top Secret
At Fremont until late tonight, Giga tomorrow, Fremont Sunday. GA4 is great, but have to say that GA3 crew is pulling off miracles against all odds.
Its actually pretty fun building electric cars. Product is useful to other people & good for environment. I think thats fundamental goodness.
2 others Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesnt change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.
3 others When I was a kid, I built model airplanes, trainsets, rockets (mixed my own powder), explosives (kinda surprised I still have all fingers), a radio, lots of software. Built a primitive MRI machine in college.
Will be there in next release
2 others Yeah, but Im not sure what the big deal is. I like building things. If that ends up being useful work too, even better.
"Try saying bug report. Might work better. Ironic if the bug report about bug reports isnt working :)"
We will add a config to lower the alert
2 others Today. Its kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.
Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
2 others Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.
What would you love to see in a Tesla pickup truck? I have a few things in mind, but what do you think are small, but important nuances & what would be seriously next level?
Appreciate all the good wishes. First bday Ive spent in the factory, but its somehow the best.
"Youre welcome! Ryan McCaffrey  Jun 26, 2018 This is crazy (in a good way)! Since I placed my order, the following things have happened: -Bigger/better sport brakes added -Red brake calipers added -Aluminum pedals added ...And the price went DOWN by $6,000. I am ECSTATIC right now!! Now I just need it in my garage!"
Pickup truck will have power outlets allowing use of heavy duty 240V, high power tools in field all day. No generator needed.
The Tesla Truck will have dual motor all-wheel drive w crazy torque & a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard.
For sure! When doing US govt crash safety testing, the Model S roof was so strong, it broke their testing machine. The Tesla Model S Is So Safe It Broke the Crash-Testing Gear The Tesla Model S may be the safest vehicle ever tested by the Feds. So safe, in fact, that according to the automaker, the all-electric sedan broke the testing equipment.
That goes without saying Watch Elon Musk's Tesla car being used as a boat Elon Musk says his car can be used as a boat when needed, after Sanzhar Altayev drove his Tesla Model S car through more than three feet deep water in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
Could be very close call. Earth is 4.5B years old & sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in 0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldnt have happened at all.
All Tesla vehicles come with cabin overheat protection electrek.co Tesla releases important Model 3 update with Summon feature, cabin overheat protection and WiFi Tesla started pushing a new software update to its fleet of vehicles this week. We reported on the features for Model S and Model X vehicles, but we now learn that the update is even more significant...
300,000 lb towing capacity
It will parallel park automatically & have 360 degree cameras & sonar
That will be standard
400 to 500 mile option definitely. Higher, maybe.
Sad news. He wrote some epic sci fi.
This doesnt take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla.
I hate whole idea of brands and branding. So much bs. I hope it messes with our brand. Brands suck.
Oh, I love trap. Good suggestions welcome!
Humanity is not perfect, but its all weve got
As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death & hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe & open to all.
Yes. Highly recommend doing so btw.
Sir, this will not be some a dainty little buttercup of a truck! Drivers seat will be big enough to fit Andr the giant (love that guy).

Happily for the victorious , he is indeed still far faster than Godot. Line-Storm comes closer to nipping at his heel (?), but Prufrock will make it a true nail-biter race!

We didnt steal his mug crayon drawing of a farting unicorn, We didnt benefit from it, We dont want it, And we still offered to pay for it. You are a jackass.
Then you will really hate that Tesla scored 100/100 four years in a row on LGBTQ equality Tesla  Dec 14, 2017 Very proud to have scored 100/100 for the fourth year in a row in LGBTQ equality. Thanks to everyone at Tesla for making LGBTQ inclusion an important part of our culture.
5 others This Washington Post article seems good Analysis  Fact-checking immigration spin on separating families and 1,500 lost children Separating immigrant families is a Trump administration policy, not a Democratic one as the president says. And 1,500 kids were not lost.
We need more & better emojis now!!Seriously. So little to work with.
6 others We should always be concerned about the welfare of children & those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan & often inaccurate
6 others Important to read the Wash Post article. The unable to account for number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.
Virtue signaling is super annoying & there are lots of phoneys who are actually huge jerks, but jump on every social cause du jour. But Im really proud of the fact that # of changes Tesla had to make to achieve 100/100 (before even knowing about the LGBTQ index) was zero.
Thats cool. One of my favorite lines! Monty Python is so brilliant.
A billion at most, so 20% max. Still basically in the nick of time from an age-of-Earth standpoint.
6 others  of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHSs phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing

Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.
With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space
Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed. BBC Breaking News  Jul 7, 2018 The complex mission to rescue the 12 trapped boys and their football coach from a cave in Thailand has begun Follow our live page for more updates Show this thread
Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.
Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience & tenacity of kids & diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.
Thanks for letting us use your pool
It is an honor to work with them
Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one
I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz 
Thanks, but weve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people.
Its open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand
Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
I would def recommend this
Youre welcome. Happy birthday!
Yes. All-weather. 300km/h high altitude winds. 60km/h ground winds. Its a beast.
According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages
Im in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we couldve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future.
Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then its on a plane to Thailand
Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio & phone/music player.
Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs 40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.
4 handles/hitch points on front & 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front & 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.
Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights & adjust bouyancy.
Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. Theyre prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. 60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
3 others Python is done right. Great name story too.
2 others Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack.
4 others Tight control code is always C
Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.
Yeah, thats what Im talking about in that tweet  double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.
2 others Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.
Tube diameter is 31cm

Just finished an amazing 3 day visit to China. The world has never seen human energy & vigor at such scale. Incredibly impressed with Tesla China team & potential for the future.
This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now its there for anyone who needs it in future. Somethings messed up if this is not a good thing.
Excellent meetings with senior leaders in China. Very thoughtful about the long-term future.
For now, reply to my tweet with ppm & ppb test results & will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email , but Im in China so that wont be working until tomorrow.
Whether you plan to buy a Dual Motor Performance Model 3 or not, take it for a test drive anyway. Its like having pure fun jacked straight into your brain whenever you want.
Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
Sure, will call tomorrow
Happy birthday, Malala! Happy to support.
I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
Youre right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but theyve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues & hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good.
They should go where their heart takes them, but some of the boys seem to be interested in physics & engineering
Damn, now I want donuts
Performance version suspension is 1cm lower & has stronger brakes in upgrade package
It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline
Would love to. Its been too long.
Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump & generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue.
Definitely. Cant wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon.
The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued & water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.
Yeah, but I got 100 gp & Roc Feather of Never-ending Tickles

Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent & politically moderate. Doesnt mean Im moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me & I dont understand why they are not important to everyone.
As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader.
Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone.
That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes.
Dont be too quick to lick. That could go wrong. Look closely & smell first. Ur welcome.

Definitely. We gave up some grip & width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires & wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims & tires.
Phew . Yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago & people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?
Yes, that will probably be its first use
Makes me very sad indeed, but also the fault is mine by far
Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime & save lives of many birds.
2 others Exactly. Overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap maintain & your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked.
Looks good, but so many details need to be right. Journey back from hypersonic becomes extremely difficult as velocity increases. Altitude is easy, velocity is hard.

Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother & less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)
I dont have a controlling vote now & wouldnt expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I wont be selling in either scenario.
Were working on a new Tesla mini-car that can squeeze in an adult
My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if were private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelitys SpaceX investment.
Def worth it. Model 3 Performance is next-level.
Great work by . Need the neural interface soon to enable human/AI symbiosis.
Model S P100D is def still the top end, but Model 3 Performance is higher value for money
Much more interesting
Games & other refinements will go to all Tesla S, X & 3 from start of production. Autopilot enhancements apply to all Model 3s plus S & X made in last few years (needs Autopilot Hardware V2.0 or higher).
Early access will have bugs (usually minor, but you never know for sure), so would not advise early access unless youre prepared to have something go wrong

2 others Probably V10 alpha build
Youre most welcome! Sorry for the delay.
Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling & driving feel. Extremely important metric.
A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldnt spend computing power on sound
Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts
Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car.
Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V
Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
Long-term, there will be thousands and eventually, hopefully, millions of missions & anyone will be able to go
Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear & still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.
Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. Its not sustainable long-term.
Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia & other important car terms at

True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months & all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.

Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.
Also, youll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight
When the only existing life was a sponge
First movie I ever saw in theaters
Although it was in the precambrian era
Amazing results by at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing 60% of global EV battery output!
Theyre great! Honored to work with them.
#s r wrong, but in Tesla makes s 4 overseas & East Coast in 1st half of quarter
Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon & say whos the pet now

Sounds like pure luxury! When I said sponge, I was actually speaking metaphorically. Truth is, I was just a simple nucleotide, drifting alone in small crevice with 3 trillion siblings.
Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
Long-term, the car will work purely on vision, with radar just a plus, but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway
4 others Yes, Germany has outstanding engineering talent
3 others Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa & South America end of next year, with broader expansion in
2 others To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.
Tesla will manufacture all battery modules & packs at China Giga, as we do today in California & Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.
2 others Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China & Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases.
2 others Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation
If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S & X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people.
"We know well run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe?

Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster
Good, but not hospital grade. S & X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid & alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model
Aiming for orbital flight by June
That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
Because people on the ground know more about whats actually needed than politicians do
Wont land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield & high Mach control surfaces are what we cant test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety.
Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms & partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)
No, were building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas
Fair point, will reenable

The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks & we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent Careers  The Boring Company
Not much but it is ours
Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks & a picture.
Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet.
Would be fun to add to Tesla
Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, its better to use trucks. Single load/unload & direct to owner location.
Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe & Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently.
While (!castle) brick++;
We bought some trucking companies & secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain
Will try again next month
We have to truck to departure rail head & truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too & trains dont leave often.
Easily accessible energy
That would be awesome
Renaming BFR to Starship
Listening to Better Now open. Better Now Post Malone  Song 
Congratulations on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.

Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster
"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage & Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earths deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
Missed miku concert sigh
No, were just going to accelerate BFR
Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. Thats a great van. We will inquire.
Lot on our plate, so its either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler & produce sooner or do all & produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster.
China, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation & transport
Haha, just like Super Troopers
No, its the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon
Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA & USAF are supportive.
Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
No, but perhaps in a few years
Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app.
What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.
No, its got enough load capacity & volume to carry the battery pack & our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.
In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts & processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast
Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not.
Should be possible. Please ask service & lmk response.

"Tracking shot of Falcon water landing 0:42 3.2M views"
Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon.
None shall pass! The Boring Company  Dec 1, 2018 Final round of interviews Show this thread
Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out & launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim.
Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged & is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched.
Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad.
We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
It is so hard to move in armor!
Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump & lines.
Not worth going below 80% imo. Even 90% is still fine. Also, no issue going to 5% or lower SoC.
Incoming rocket & fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon
Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if theres no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop & turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here.
Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Cant wipe it off.
Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth.
Were adding police car, fire truck & ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months
As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic.
Prof Dahn is correct (hes great), but the relative benefit is small. Id recommend 10% more SoC for convenience.

Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. Were also working on vision-only driving.

If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars & takes highway interchanges & off-ramps.
"Tesla history trivia: we didnt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. Hed originally filed for it in 1994.

Youre right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with tell a more interesting story.
5 others 60 Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to 14 mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party.

Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.
Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago!
This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go
Youre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didnt include it. Were working on one that makes things clear.
Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this wont matter for the first few layers
Exactly. Its a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
2 others The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber & a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.
3 others Autopilot doesnt need the guide wheels. Theyre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp & elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) & tow or flatbed it out
Passive lateral safety is required by regulators & I think theyre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.

Tesla team did a great job!
This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.

Im not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the 2 rear seats.
Aiming to finish initial construction this summer, start Model 3 production end of year & reach high volume production next year
Plus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance
Shanghai Giga output is just for greater China, not North America. Affordable cars must be made on same continent as customers.
Thats a reasonable question
Yes, will be extremely intense. Early flights are especially dangerous, as theres a lot of new hardware.
Aiming for 4 weeks, which probably means 8 weeks, due to unforeseen issues

1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, 1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.
Since its part of safety & security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it
I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night & fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze & block cooling channels.
Awesome moose sculpture!

Its an honor, sir! Thanks for owning a Tesla.
Cool that this is happening on many fronts. Looks like a good design by .
Yeah, worked on my cousins farm for six weeks around my 18th birthday. I was so kewl.
Its like looking in a mirror!
That would be so cool!
Yes, and my grandfather was from Minnesota with some Scandinavian/German background. Got to hand it to Norway. Thats a great sculpture!
Feature has now been in place for 8 months
Ok, well throw that in too
Rough beta in 2 to 3 weeks
All doors unlock automatically when the Tesla comes to a stop after an accident. There is both primary & backup power to doors, brakes, steering & airbags.
Sure hope that happens
Many cold weather improvements coming via OTA software
These are industrial strength. Not recommended for use at home!
Sure. Also, we need to be better at remembering brightness settings.

Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the worlds factories every day
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship & booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) & sea-level thrust optimized (250 ton).
I do like nonsense memes. Its true.

Im openly moderate. There, I said it.
No plans to do so. Would recommend Model S.
We will when it rolls out
Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart
That might be the ultimate superpower
2 others Sure, which ones?
Absolutely. Youve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
To be clear, Im confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature & reduced need for heat shielding
Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher & doesnt even need paint!
Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F
Youre most welcome! Very thoughtful questions.
Haha how is this even real?
Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime & angle of attack
And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar
2 others Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
Yes. Its very rare to find all three.
Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps & main engines for landing orientation, so wont need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably.
Well tweak the alloy over time, so it wont exactly be 301, but close
Raptor just achieved power level needed for Starship & Super Heavy
I want you too baby Mars  Feb 8, 2019 I don't want you. Only Elon. t.co/NKxpkQQRyf
First firing of Starship Raptor flight engine! So proud of great work by team!!
Design requires at least 170 metric tons of force. Engine reached 172 mT & 257 bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means 10% to 20% more with deep cryo.
The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just Starship & sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy
Gaseous CH4/O2 & heavy duty spark plugs. Basically, a of insane power
VAT of 20% & import duties of 10% usually result in a 30% higher cost in Europe
Sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time. Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow.
Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles.
Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other & lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact, for many states in the US, its way better.
Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
2 others Spark plugs ignite dual blow torches that ignite preburners & main chamber
Engine use methox torch igniters. Green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the chamber.
2 others Will do, although SpaceX reddit is very well-informed. Really impressive analysis by some commenters.
2 others Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!
Booster center of mass is much lower & more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry
Rocket booster temperatures wont go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body & maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.

The goodwill of the public is critical to Starships success
This will sound implausible, but I think theres a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon
2 others Very dependent on volume, but Im confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k & maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth & move to Mars if they want.
I think 6 where we lit main chamber & several with only preburners
Definitely! Its amazing that the RD-170 & RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.
3 others Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress & setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!
2 others Yeah, but simpler. Needed for landing burn or engines will suck in a bubble.
2 others A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.
Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do 300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.
2 others Starship & Super Heavy will press tanks autogenously even in version 1. Very important, as helium costs more than oxygen on Falcon, even though liquid oxygen is 2/3 vehicle mass & helium weighs basically nothing.
Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
Of course I still love you

True, that headline is not exactly going to win a Pulitzer for originality
Agreed. Also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location.
I had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering & manufacturing problems at Tesla (especially) & SpaceX
Also, Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI & I didnt agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do. Add that all up & it was just better to part ways on good terms.
It will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues and then, if that looks good, speed up next week. We def need to add a Request Latest Update feature!
Probably a month or two. Sentry mode became top priority, so pushed that out a bit.

Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life.
Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. Thats scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big.
Its designed to be way better. Well see what reality has to say about that.
Focusing on Starship instead
Deorbits & burns up over the Pacific
7 others Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight.
9 others SN2 has changes that should help
Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so
Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads & Dragon abort thrusters.
Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for launch capability. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.
7 others Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done
"Exactly. Thats the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure & temperature in oxygen preburner
8 others Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done.
SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight & thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but Im worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.
6 others Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
7 others Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space.
Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.
5 others Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing High engine chamber pressure and ablative dont get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.
4 others Thats true Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.
Stop censoring science!
Meetings are a valuable use of time!

Indeed. I have great respect for judges. Its not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system.
Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco & other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceXs success. Great respect & appreciation!
I think we should do something here. Will talk with team & send out a note in next few days.
Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only 50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. Its 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder.
5 others Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel.
2 others Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Cant print yet.
5 others Yes, exciting potential

Long-term, its about coupling the collective will of humanity to AI. Short-term, its about improving the lives of those with brain or spine problems.
Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too
Next software update will increase storm watch sensitivity. Youre right, its currently too low.
2 others When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought dont want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.
Our list prices are our actual prices. Software (and automotive) vary prices frequently by changing the discount or rebate.
However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference  about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team & board.
Software release later this week should make it better
Plug in a USB drive to record video

First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.
White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around 1650 Kelvin
No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps
If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day 8, thats fine
Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing. Zero refurbishment.
Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer
Still get this question a lot, even though Norway has highest Tesla cars per person on (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.
3 others Only some of the hottest sections
Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine & stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.
2 others Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship & Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
2 others We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Dont need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. Were simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to 50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.
Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but thats a lot of complexity.
Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isnt critical for snowy regions.
2 others Definitely down the road, once construction & upgrades arent so crazy
2 others This causes some media confusion, as batch builds & ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month & terrible following month, but consumer tastes dont actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.
Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations & we try to build in batches to simplify production
4 others Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots
Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout 
You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump & combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
4 others Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium & carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint.

Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon.
Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow.
Probably no fairing either & just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of 30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with 1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see whats there. Not impossible.
I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo.

4 others Like the movie Us. Scary  but also empathetic.
Yes. Sensitive propulsion & avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon
Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained. Yes, but were going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads.
2 others Were going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot & fast, so dicey.
2 others Annoying that perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy cant. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but thats very rare.
4 others No, but for sure the other way around!
4 others Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you cant hear, but you can feel in your chest
Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last years vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer & max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.

Max thrust of 2550 tons will be almost 10% higher than Falcon Heavy demo mission last year
Team is working on international versions super hard btw. Unfortunately, regulators around the world have different rules & processes, so just takes time.
Thats exactly the idea. Whats not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software & going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April

Love Brunel. Great first name too.
Yeah, Id love to do that
Building primary structure completion seems on track for May, but then it will take several months to install & activate factory equipment
That would be cool. Color variation causes havoc though.
It will enable video when parked & connected to WiFi. All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time.
Base AP will have same NN, so core functionality also improves

Hi Nina! So  how many  would it take? Just between us.
Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles/km of real-world lane changes with reliability >> human.

Starship is kinda Gundam
Boring candy coming soon 
We will. You read it right.
Holman Jenkins & WSJ in general are sock puppets of big oil
Starship will land on a ring of fire
Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at 24GWh/yr & have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla wont spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
Model 3 drive unit & body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.
Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesnt have access to the video unless sent to us by owner.
2 others Im sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They cant *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ expos pieces on oil, coal & gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps theyre all angels 
There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase
Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later.
There is 35 GWh/yr theoretical capacity, but actual max output is 2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3s in Q1 due to cell constraints.
6 others How embarrassing. Will change.
5 others Ive always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport & energy
Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesnt cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability
Very much so. There are 2.5B cars & trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but thats a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -> demand >> supply.
2 others Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false.
Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so 400,000 of Tesla cars built to date

6 others Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range 15 degrees
7 others Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly & at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move & increases moment of inertia.

Yeah, the fear, uncertainty & doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights
No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.
Given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars, their future resale value cars will be low. Consumers are starting to realize this.
Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. Well get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits & arrays are tracking to sun.
Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites & allow some amount of yaw steering.

China EV subsidies mostly end this month & fully end in about 7 months

Heat will breathe life into Mars
These do seem like wise words
3 others Sure, that would be an honor
Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
Colonizing Mars one mug at a time!
We poured our heart & soul into it. Lot of hubris too, but no regrets. Faberg egg of cars.
Working on Tesla global logistics
Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
High entry force & heat breached engine bay & center engine TVC failed
Merkindise coming soon!
I know  sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
No, its along the way
6 others Thats actually kinda true
They have the best merkins
Im such a bad public speaker! Damn.
Yes, but we couldnt take a chance on 2nd stage failing its 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything Im aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well.
"4 others Yes! I love botanical gardens. This is my favorite:"
We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
3 others He was the real deal
There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
Sure. Want to add easy import/export of images from your phone.
That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher & stability of booster in ground winds is low
1000, as all seats would be coach & no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. Its basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
Waiting for Falcon Heavy to launch means high cortisol levels. This is our toughest rocket launch ever.
That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disneys Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but youd exit on another continent.
2 others One of our main conference rooms at SpaceX is named after Goddard
High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
3 others Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower & Starship doesnt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
2 others Youre touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. Were fixing that with Starship.
Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.

Reason for top rating is that active steering & braking safety features of Tesla Autopilot are turned on no cost for all cars Tesla Model 3 Can Survive a Crashand Avoid One, Too The Model 3 scores well in European crash testing, a day after Tesla reported a quarterly record for deliveries.
Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves.
We must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on Earth & becoming multiplanetary via Mars. Its not clear how much time we have to do these things, but sooner is definitely better.
FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is 400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in 5 years.
Active safety will continue to improve via over-the-air software updates. Since all Tesla cars are connected, we analyze each accident & do our best to minimize probability of recurrence.
Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less & convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines
Best crash safety system is not crashing in the first place. Makes a world of difference for pedestrians & cyclists especially.

Starship Mk 1 & Hopper
Upgrading to 250kW soon
When sheets come loose all dignity is lost
All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer & all production in past few months has FSD computer
The Cape is one of the two Starship build sites. More on this later.
End of Q4, most likely
Local supporters will be invited!
Will do Starship presentation a few weeks after Hopper hovers, so prob late July. If that timing works, free LJ chips for all present!
This is why its possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of 500k & make at least 500k FSD cars
3 others To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car
This shampoo sounds amazing
2 others Between first development engine & first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware & software. Over time, thousands.
Intersections with complex traffic lights & shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety.
Production fully switched over 3 months ago. Functionality wont diverge until Q4, as its limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies.
3 others Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising.

There is no refreshed Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. Most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency Model 3 rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit. That went into production 3 months ago.
Done. Im feeling & Im feeling navigation buttons coming with next software release.
Absolutely agree, you should be allowed to move your Tesla anywhere in the world, unless its prevented by government rules. Thanks for letting me know.
I think so. Will check.
2 others Probably 5mph or 8 km/h
6 others SpaceX thruster package will be subtle. Hidden behind license plate.
2 others Good progress on fast activation of summon down to 1 second
3 others Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year
Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
4 others Will trace back inertial measurements & wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off
5 others That was a real sign
About right, but dangerously chuggy & risking bad things at 40%. Well keep it above 50% for this flight.
2 others Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers.
2 others More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO 27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin /2, as I recall, but doesnt matter, as theres no geo anywhere near that mass.
3 others I actually asked Ashlee Vance not to write the book several times. Inevitably, some things are wrong and then those errors are repeated for years.
100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never.
Agreed, its a small, but important, feature

This guy is not a cofounder of Neuralink. Was at company briefly, but he didnt work out.
This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space, rapidly iterating on rocket & space station technology. Great respect.
Agreed. Thats approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.

Thoughtful analysis. We will endeavor to provide the robots, chips & software to academia.
Streaming. Check Neuralink website later today. Starts around 8pm.
2 others Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications
No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot
Is there a longer edit I can post?
3 others No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
2 others If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from 12 hours/week to 60 hours/week
2 others Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably $75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you cant make enough of them & we wont be able to.
Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as youd expect.

Cant you just play though phone Bluetooth?
Yes, V10 will include several games & infotainment features, improved highway Autopilot, better traffic light & stop sign recognition & Smart Summon
Were close, but the magic is in the final details. Maybe 2 to 3 months.
Were working on it. Agreed, Minecraft is high priority. Roblox too.
Probably 1/4 to 1/2 of that capacity would be for stationary storage

Unity port is done, so finessing the controls now. Mostly limited by local storage. Will allow additional game storage via USB. Whatevers most fun!
Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
Not currently in V10, but will try
Thanks for letting me know
Yes, really enjoyed it, although wish shed made it up to sky city
Thin tiles on windward side of ship & nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
Will recognize & read all signs for FSD. Focused on traffic lights & stop signs right now. Most are very easy. Difficulty is millions of corner cases.
Depends on how release to owners with early access goes, but hopefully wide release by end of August
If not immediately, will be followed shortly in a point release

Orbital refilling is vital to humanitys future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first.
Mailing Dragon dock with Space Station is much harder than docking with our own ship for refilling. Not a problem.
Not sure. Will check with my team.
For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes.

FSD owners will get priority in the upload queue
Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes
No plans to introduce air suspension on Model 3 at this time
Probably every 2 to 4 months, depending on how much progress we make
Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge
Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.
3 others Were working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesnt quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world.
Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B
3 others Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident.
2 others Were accelerating opening up configurator/order page for more countries. Sorry, lot on our plate!
Dont know enough about Georges company, but it sounds like hes focused on a machine vision approach, which is the only general solution imo

Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins & landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September
Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
Initially Model 3, later Y
Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
Dont know yet, but its important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so well make costs as low as possible
Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth & gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming
Meaning less than a century. But this would be pretty intense.
Not risky imo & can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar systems fusion reactor (the sun).
Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters
AF certification required an enormous amount of work. Its mostly design-review based, not flight-based.
True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids & a mass driver, but this is risky.

4 others Failure rate is actually both higher & lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.
Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell & fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.

Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
There arent really meant to be Tesla incentives, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
"2 others Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we dont raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally & should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
2 others Thats not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous & possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why Im looking into it

Thats correct. Essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver.
It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating
Wow, its been 5 years since we started at Boca!
2 others Hoping to open in Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia & most of Eastern Europe early next year. Finally, we will do Nikola Tesla proud by having his cars in his countries of origin!
This includes original engineering of new factory processes & cars. Great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported, not just localization.
Six. Two windward, one under each fin & two leeward. Provides redundancy for landing on unimproved surfaces.
About a week. Will include slight improvements, based on initial user feedback.
Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
3 others We could probably do that
Youre welcome! Feature requests always appreciated.
2 others OG Roadster is def helping us out here with 826M miles by itself
Better just to ride your max temp all the way down & let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
We look for rare corner case issues with a limited release US build, then expand internationally as we receive approval from regulatory authorities. So, soon, but hard to say exactly.
It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
Mk1 ship is around 200 tons dry & 1400 tons wet, but aiming for 120 by Mk4 or Mk5. Total stack mass with max payload is 5000 tons.
2 others That would be a nice touch
This is quite a complex beast, but hopefully within a month or so
For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.
Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling & quite robust
Many powerful electric motors & batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th.
With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They dont stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great.
Almost entirely C++, but we did have an (advanced for the time) client-side Java app for viewing maps & (weirdly) a 3D hockey game in VRML

Special light pattern (but not hazards, as theyre too shrill) seems right
Bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back
What blows my mind is that peak pressure in regen chamber & nozzle is *far* above combustion pressure at over 800 bar or 12,000 psi
Probably our most viral feature ever. Most of the Autopilot team has been working on this, led by Ashok, CJ, Andrej & many others.
Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right & not needed with steel.
8 others Agreed & such a heartwarming photo
Raptor cost is tracking to well under $1M for V1.0. Goal is <$250k for V2.0 is a 250 ton thrust-optimized engine, ie <$1000/ton
Great summary of the key points!
4 others Its all the secondary structure that concerns me, not engines & primary airframe
Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing & machining of Raptor  far more than in design of the engine itself!
Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints & dissimilar metals at such high pressure & temperature is what I find remarkable about it.
5 others Thats about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot & have to be replaced.
No, weve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have & well get around to it, but not needed for flight.
I have that exact thought every time I get the flu

2 others Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W > 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with >260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve 380 sec, but T/W probably <120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
2 others Were working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that arent actual parking spaces.
3 others Conservation of energy tells you the answer

4 others Also, were keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so thats leaving a lot on the table
It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when & how fast to move the wipers.
2 others Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. en.m.wikipedia.org Oberth effect - Wikipedia
3 others Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines
2 others Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen & oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.
2 others This is true. All that matters is number used in v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. en.m.wikipedia.org Delta-v - Wikipedia
2 others We def could be wrong about this, but its actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place & only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Dont need a lot of room & moment of inertia is much lower.

Great work by SpaceX Dragon team & Airborne! To be clear, weve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row. SpaceX  Nov 3, 2019 SpaceX team has completed 13 successful tests in a row of upgraded Mark 3 parachutes for Crew Dragon. Most recent test demonstrated the parachute systems ability to land the spacecraft safely in the unlikely event that one of the four main parachutes fails.
Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called Low Gear!
Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is 80% reusable, but reflight takes several days & requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours & ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be 20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
Would be odd to expect anything else
Fair point. Coming soon. Were making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.

As the planets align only once every two years
If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so 100 vehicles & each does 100 tons to orbit, thats a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous & difficult than Earth & take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. Thats the sales pitch. Want to go?
Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as its designed to fly 3X per day, which is 1000X per year
Without a fully & rapidly reusable orbital rocket, humanity will never be a multiplanet species
A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half
The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF
No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is whats hard.
SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle & no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldnt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
Exactly! Its also a far more exciting & inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).

Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too
Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then Im confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity & lower part count.
The body panels will actually be laser cut!
Were creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but well need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it cant be made using standard methods.

Your Twitter comments are great btw!
We can prob reduce width by an inch & maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.

They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! Its pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars.
Huge admiration & respect for the Tesla China team. Their talent & drive is amazing!
There will be no loss of either
That will require a full redesign, but probably 73 inches or 185 cm width
Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in 93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed.

Yes, probably & partially
MCU (infotainment computer) upgrade not recommended imo. Isnt needed for full self-driving & cost is $2k for limited entertainment improvements.
Needs a few more days of validation, then early access, then wide release
No, as thats OG Mobileye hardware
I think we can improve that with a little software optimization
This is quite a thorny hardware problem, as there are many diff versions of mcu & autopilot computer & supporting hardware. Cars last so much longer than phones! Hopefully able to upgrade mcu1 & ap2.0 in a few months.
Yes, just costs a few thousand dollars & is more complex than a board swap. Bunch of connectors & antennas need to change. We can improve the speed a little with software optimization, which might be enough.

Thats certainly our impression, but its an old version of Tesla software, so effect is limited
Sorry, its been a bit of a struggle. Software team has been working all weekend to resolve last minute issues. Hopefully starts rolling out tonight.

Amazing work by Tesla China team!!
Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter & more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need 1.5 megawatts. Its like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!
Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts & fixtures. Hopefully get that done in
Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed & TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints & 20% mass reduction.
New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zenos Paradox  at any given point, youre halfway there
Crew Dragon should be physically ready & at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months
Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation & electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isnt critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!
No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 & O2 from Raptor
Took me an embarrassingly long time to learn that
I def believe in the ethical treatment of animals & taking action of climate, but these are mostly separate moral issues
3 others Slight tweak to the glass needed & then it should be good to go
Spin start from COPVs so the ox & fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome.
Building prototypes is relatively easy, volume production is hard
Beyond awesome. He was the real deal.
2 others Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn
Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship.
Were focusing on Boca right now for Starship & Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
Many ways to solve this problem, but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces. When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque.
Is purchasing through the Tesla app not working?
Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld 4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels & domes?
Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc & steel melt pool.
Tesla app based payment will soon be rolled out WW. Its tough making functionality work across so many regulatory domains.

A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps & pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
2 others Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of 10% in case of CH

Aiming for 20 to 30 years, like aircraft
Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is 78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!
Yeah. A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars.
Whats amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is 38% of Earth gravity.
Needs to be such that anyone can go if they want, with loans available for those who dont have money
Even more important for a a reusable rocket, as cost of propellant actually becomes relevant & anything below T/W of 1 is wasted fuel & oxygen
Densification isnt needed to return the ship & limited cargo from Mars, but its an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed

Ok sure Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldnt be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.
Desperate times call for desperate measures 
2 others First, we need to make it super safe & easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production & implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.
Wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year. Its *awesome*.

Youre welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
Starlink will be great for any sparsely populated areas with expensive or little to no connectivity!
Once upon a time, we were all just hydrogen in a vacuum
This isnt quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision thats 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures & welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.
That said, although substantial capital & engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because its built inside a factory in volume.
We saw them a lot launching from Kwajalein in the early days of SpaceX
Fine, but that was an easy one
Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be <2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.
No, theyre SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.
Yes, were tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering & building a heavy duty planisher to flatten & cold work the weld area

Hard to believe that is high efficiency solar power seamlessly integrated into beautiful roof tiles. Great work by SolarGlass engineering, Giga NY factory & Tesla installation teams!
The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics & energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.
This is incorrect. No air suspension planned for 3/Y. Only S/X & Cybertruck have/will have air suspension.
"Your comment above: Who in their right mind would buy an ICE after 2025 knowing its residual value will be zilch? Legacy auto: go EV or go BUST! is super important for car buyers. Residual values for gas/diesel cars will plummet in coming years."
Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. Its stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos dont do it justice.
Europe & China timing will be announced soon
First two domes in frame are for SN2, third is SN1 thrust dome
Many Bay Area installations are ongoing now
Probably 6 months or so. 301 is certainly fine for orbit, but SpaceX 30X will be better.
Unfortunately, Starship unlikely to survive LEO entry intact without shielding on windward side, but none required on leeward. Even windward shielding is very light.
Its integrated roof & solar, so should be light enough for almost any home
Coming hopefully later this year
Yes, but we want to focus on textured black first, then move into Earth tones & convolutions
No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, its very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles.
I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice & snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!
Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!

OpenAI should be more open imo
True, that was pretty impressive
Reminded me of The Lady of Shalott by Waterhouse
Unfortunately, I must agree that these are reasonable concerns
Maybe possible with improved wheels/tires (which would be available to all previously made cars)
Initially, yes, but then will make sense to localize closer to customers. Pretty much same plan as vehicles.
All orgs developing advanced AI should be regulated, including Tesla
Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is
Shielding is only needed for orbital speeds
Might be used around flap joints
Theres a tough performance vs range tradeoff. Plaid has absurd performance, while holding range roughly constant.
Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months
Editing error. Meant to say t/(2E). Interesting that monochrome is roughly a millionth of a percent.
2 others X will also improve by a similar amount
Direct links arent needed to offer service. Starlink will initially bounce signals off ground/ocean relays to get from to .
Thanks to all who caught the error
albedo will drop significantly on almost every successive launch
Regulations require calling it something else, so we added +
I have no control & only very limited insight into OpenAI. Confidence in Dario for safety is not high.
The joints will have shielding, but its hard to ensure a good seal. Transpiration cooling (or simply higher pressure cold gas flow) would purge the area behind the hot gas seal.
2 others Depends on when car was built, as there are many small hardware improvements, so most will be somewhere in between 373 &
Science has gone too far

The Persuader hammer will fix SN
In the order that they were written
I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank
Active ride height & active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
Btw, in some prior tweets Id said production Cybertruck would be 80 wide (vs 84 body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82, but come standard with upper laser blade lights.
Attach wheels to the landing legs & tow Starship to the launch pad
These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full & rapid reuse with payload to orbit of 2%.
SN 2+ will have better fit & weld quality. Later serial numbers will use bigger stampings, so much less weld length.
Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient & range, latter factoring in route elevation changes & cargo or tow mass & drag impact
There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.
F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production & thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main.
The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit
Header tanks are only 2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. Pressurized volume is still 1000 cubic meters.
Its mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light & back is heavy due to engines & landing legs.
Battle Angel Starship
Its not that big really
SN2 tank integration starts this week with much less circumferential pucker. Thanks Fronius!
Teslas in a tunnel. Happening in Vegas rn.

The competitor should be a drone fighter plane thats remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy. The F-35 would have no chance against it.
We had the wrong settings! To make the welds super flat & strong, were building a heavy duty, custom planisher, but just having the right settings is a major improvement.
Mad respect for the makers of things
Bernies tax rate is 0.2% too high!
Sleeving SN2 dome in the high bay
Yes, dramatically improved imo
No matter what, we need to pressurize the production system. Rocket design is relatively easy, making one is hard, making many is extremely hard. Manufacturing is underrated.
True. Oddly, those who complained didnt actually order FSD. Perhaps they werent aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the FSD option is ordered even after delivery.
Theres a puck at the base that takes the engine thrust load. Dont shuck the puck!
Also, when tech is new, catalog engineering isnt possible, as there is no catalog. Has to be first principles.
Track mode V2 is pretty cool. Maybe too complicated to use though? Lmk thoughts for improvement.
Cool, were tracking to release more FSD features later this month
We need to finish work on Autopilot core foundation code & 3D labelling, then functionality will happen quickly. Not long now.
Were stripping SN2 to bare minimum to test the thrust puck to dome weld under pressure, first with water, then at cryo. Hopefully, ready to test in a few days.
2 others Were making progress. Improved rules are going through the EU standards committees. Hopefully better in a few months.

Raising art to new heights
Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date & over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating & virus will exceed mass of known universe!
Yeah, thats a great one
Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses & other colds in general population is very high!
Market was bit high anyway, so due for a correction
SN2 (with thrust puck) passed cryo pressure & engine thrust load tests late last night
Recent missed landing (at sea) was due to incorrect wind data. If this (land) landing fails, it will most likely be for a different reason.
Static fire & short flights with SN3, longer flights with SN4, but spooling up the whole Starship/Raptor production line is really what matters
Ships with a lot of people & limited medical facilities are a serious issue
Thanks for taking us through this today. Hopefully, such horrors will never again be repeated in reality.

Yeah. There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent, but it didnt affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having 9 engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission.
Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website. New confirmed cases, not oft-reported presumptive positive is trending to level off over next few weeks & be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China.
Was also given a lot of doxycycline en.m.wikipedia.org Doxycycline - Wikipedia
Yeah, most reflights ever!
If Jamis needs help, he has many friends, me among them
2 others Yeah. Fate loves irony.
Yeah, that will be a great milestone
I was first misdiagnosed at Stanford Hospital with viral meningitis, then again misdiagnosed at Sequoia. A visiting doc from San Jose General saw my charts & sent me to ICU immediately. I was 36 hours from being unrecoverable. So, I take expert advice with a grain of salt 
Seems to be happening a lot
Very sensible. Knows how to handle exponential functions in reality.
Were working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter
Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids & grandparents probably most risky.
Pretty close. Design is evolving rapidly. Would be great to flatten domes, embed engines & add 1.5 barrel sections of propellant for same total length. Also, current legs are a bit too small.
Last launch aborted due to slightly high power. Possibly, but not obviously, related to today. This vehicle has seen a lot of wear, so today isnt a big surprise. Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. Wont risk non-SpaceX satellites.
2 others Whats worse is that I even told Stanford to check me for the $^#* parasite & they still couldnt find it!

Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
We have N95 masks & getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
Up to 80% false positive
A single computer, pump & pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care & avoid cross-flow risk
We expect to have over 1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed & operating is the harder part.
3 others Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority & LAX customs for acting so swiftly
"3 others No problem :)"
4 others Have let know
Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors
Well try to get & deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car & know when youre expected home, so temp & humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy.
Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if theres anything else you need.
2 others This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
Have you seen more data on HCQ & Z-Pak? Hard to find.
Youre most welcome. Were working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases & using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.
2 others Sure would love to do home hvac thats quiet & efficient, with humidity control & HEPA filter
According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries.
"Italy: On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus."
Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure, fresh water & just dump it on the ground.
3 others Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe & should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.
"3 others Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page:"
Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world
Do you have data on the false positive rate? Ive heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and presumed positive.
. pls fix awetoekreqt
Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test, so you know if youre immune. Refill blood banks & give donors peace of mind. Eric D. Hargan  Mar 27, 2020 Earlier this week, I visited to donate blood for patients who are involved in clinical trials. The #COVID-19 pandemic has created a blood and plasma shortage in America. If you are a healthy individual, please consider donating blood. One donation can save up to 3 lives.
Also makes for a great shelter
Can you do a fast antibody test?
Youre most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way.
We will give away all our ventilators, whether we buy them or build them
Stop!  In the name of love 
And many doctors are not treating patients, due to fear of giving or receiving C
Working on that with Medtronic. Given NY pressing needs, were delivering Resmed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators to NY hospitals starting tonight.
2 others Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include estimated illness onset date. This is a significantly less rigorous standard.
C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
2 others Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.
Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
Logarithm graphs coming soon
We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device & shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or know.

Youre most welcome! Impressive work by Mount Sinai team.
High quality critical feedback from Munro & Co is much appreciated!
SN3 passed ambient temperature pressure test last night, now doing cryogenic
2 others Some progress
Yes, v close! Nice work. Those are V0.9 legs, so major upgrades coming. Need wider span, longer stroke & ability to auto-level for uneven ground or leaning into high winds.
Happy we could be helpful! More available if needed.
"So many brilliant scenes. Anarcho-syndicalism! Monty Python ""Anarcho-Syndicalist Commune"
We will see what data review says in the morning, but this may have been a test configuration mistake
Some valves leaked at cryo temp. Fixing & will retest soon.
Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed & Philips ventilators before delivery & all confirmed they would be critical.
Hopefully, Starship will have enough flight history to substitute for Dragon for NASA missions too
"And how to tell if someones a witch She's a witch! Monty Python and the Holy Grail... :D"
The legs extend & telescope out, so are longer than they seem, but not as long as they will be for SN4+
Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder whos behind it.
Homelink is 3rd party hardware that increases cost of all cars, but only some people use it, so its only installed upon request. Long-term, garage openers are transitioning to WiFi-activated.
Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight.
Definitely need a wider span
Yeah, probably July 1st
Monty Python & Mel Brooks are my all-time favorites
3 others Were going to simplify Plaid a little. Was getting too complex.
Mass of initial SN ships will be a little high & Isp a little low, but, over time, it will be 150t to LEO fully reusable
Hoping to roll out traffic lights & stops to wide US release in a few weeks & probably WW release in Q3 (so many variations in each country!). Very important to make sure this is done right.
Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low.
The S-curve appears to be entering the logarithmic phase
Sounds promising. Will be interesting to see results of clinical trials.
Northwell seems to be very pragmatic & sensible. Impressive work in difficult circumstances.
2 others Oh sure, good point. Will discuss with team & make available to buy in Tesla app.
Here you go Andrew  Apr 5, 2020 Can you release the landing video of BulgariaSat-1 from 2017?
Humans drive using 2 cameras on a slow gimbal & are often distracted. A Tesla with 8 cameras, radar, sonar & always being alert can definitely be superhuman.
Certainly no problem for a 144 trillion operations per second computer to make 15 steering/acceleration/braking maneuvers per second. Thats a trillion calculations between each output command.

Twitter causes id sinuation
Puts our basic instincts on a roller coaster
3 others Hard to hide anything from the Internet! Yeah, were going to reuse much of the thrust section.
3 others There are redundant pressure control valves. Its a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
It is stable on the ground without propellant loaded, which is an improvement from OG Atlas
Probably best to keep control local, but easy to check status from afar
2 others Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe.
Love that Gen Shinseki quote!
2 others Rockets & spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo.

Partial list of hospitals to which Tesla sent ventilators
"Good progress, but 18 years to launch our first humans is a long time. Technology must advance faster or there will be no city on the red planet in our lifetime. Eric Berger  Apr 17, 2020 If SpaceX launches Crew Dragon by June 4, consider its decade: 2010: Falcon 9, Cargo Dragon debut 2012: Dragon docks with ISS 2015: Booster land landing 2016: Sea landing 2017: Booster reuse 2018: Falcon Heavy debut 2019: Starlink launch, Boca Chica expansion 2020: Crewed launch"

It is about 10% too small, but lots of fun
Youre right, will fix
Perhaps you are unaware that Twitter has a search function? The hospitals *themselves* acknowledged receipt of ventilators.
Yeah, super messed up
Congratulations again! Starfleet begins 
I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb.
2 others The way it should be!
Youre welcome! Very exciting times ahead for space.
Pretty much, although we also sent some Medtronic units, which are meant for extreme situations. Those require a lot of work to set up & operate. Should be used sparingly. SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system.

Trying have fewer parts, so strakes are unlikely. Some very counterintuitive CFD results in both hypersonic & subsonic regimes. Starship does controlled falling more than flying.
Its a hard problem, mostly due to esthetics, but its the future we should have
2 others No, as the header tanks are quite small relative to main (30 tons vs 1200 tons). Only uses very tip of the nose.
No, oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry

3 others Yes. It will even float for a while.
Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle & all sats get sunshades starting with launch
Guaranteed to make any party more fun!
Pretty much. We place high value on simulation too, but nothings as weird as reality!

2 others Yeah, and whole lot more! Aargh, Im dying to make Cybertruck like yesterday!!
2 others They are in fact being deorbited haha
Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
That is more reasonable, especially if mostly loans. Oil & gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time, but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy.
When I talked to doctors in Wuhan, they recommended against invasive ventilators & in favor of non-invasive
Yes, same results are showing up pretty much everywhere on Earth. Contagion is higher in high pop density cities & mortality proportionate to age.
New York seeing same results for invasive ventilators as Wuhan New Study Shows Nearly 9 in 10 Covid-19 Patients on Ventilators Dont Make It With no proven drugs, ventilators are one of the go-to options for ICUs and critical care doctors in working with severe cases of Covid-19 pneumonia.

Haha true. Great headline. Its quite hard to have rocket test articles not explode, as they so desperately want to!
Yes, switching soon to a 300 series alloy with higher ductility at cryogenic temp. 301 is good as sheet, but not as plate. Also, a lot of geometric changes.
"What do you make of the FT claims?

Story by me, & (free to read): Show this thread"
These wont be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder.
As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is >1000% harder than designing it
2 others How is it considered probable if theres no covid test? Is just a cough or high temperature enough?
Successive iteration of both design & manufacturing. Latter is 1000% harder than former.
Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time & reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.

2 others Yes, converts CO2 & H2O to CH4 & O2. Perfect for Mars! en.m.wikipedia.org Sabatier reaction - Wikipedia
Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
2 others Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 & 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to $100/ton in volume, so $500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or $10/kg.
2 others A fully & rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc.
In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid
No, they will be smashed beyond repair & corroded
Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine
3 others Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)
2 others Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%
Probably makes sense to have a Details section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.
Thats harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
3 others Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
Yes, this is a high priority
3 others Looks about right. Ice mining/refining on Mars & maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life.
3 others No, but its mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)
2 others Thats pretty much what happened. The cows werent sure what to do (not having encountered a rocket before), so first ran one direction, then the other.

Astronauts to orbit in 5 days!!
Much harder problem than it may seem
5 years ago. We need to accelerate progress towards fully reusable rockets. Cost per ton to orbit needs to improve by >1000% from where Falcon is today for there to be a self-sustaining city on Mars.
3 others Astronauts to orbit next week!
I am  openly moderate
New New Hampshire license plate?
Mars needs to happen soon
Reviewed design with Franz last night. Even 3% smaller is too small. Will be pretty much this size. Well probably do a smaller, tight world truck at some point.

Definitely not right that the other officers were charged with nothing. What message does this send in general to officers who stand by while another does wrong? #JusticeForGeorge
Worth noting that, as of Jan 1, Tesla buyers no longer received any federal tax credit. Model 3 led despite this disadvantage.
Must be due to relativistic aging

I guess more people need to get more involved in the party primaries (which is a chore)
So many war stories over 18 eventful years! But Starship can make life multiplanetary, which is what really matters for safeguarding the light of consciousness & life as we know it. 100X improvement over Falcon/Dragon.
Wow, hard to believe that was 10 years ago!
What a cute & happy dog!
Methalox is the right propellant. Should be staged combustion & highly reusable.
Creating the production system is >1000% harder than building one rocket. This is the truly hard thing.
4 others Jack is doing his best. I support him.
Thats when all life on Earth will be boiled off. What matters is how long civilization is capable of making the jump to Mars. This could be a very short period of time measured in decades. It took 4.5 billion years to get to this point & civilization isnt looking super stable.

Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points & charts in my reply tweets
Tesla batteries are lasting much longer than 200k miles / 320k km
Electric cars produce *much* less CO2 than fossil fuel cars, taking both electricity emission & vehicle production into acount
Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers & improving fast
Moreover, energy produced by Tesla solar deployments far exceeds energy used in our factories
Great point. Many articles are retweeted based on headlines that dont match the content.
To meme the impossible meme
Exactly, fuel cells = fool sells
Renewable energy passed coal in April
"(Formerly) mainstream media has systemic negative & political bias about almost everything. Reading major newspapers makes you feel sad & angry. Thats why theyre being crushed by . Likes/retweets of old media are extremely low. Ironic article: Opinion  Joe Rogan Is the New Mainstream Media (Published 2020) Talking to the podcasting king about his monster Spotify deal."
Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results & latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible.
Actually, were on SN30 for Raptor
3 others We shall see 
Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80s as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs.
Were working on new legs. Wider stance & able to auto-level. Important for leaning into wind or landing on rocky & pitted surfaces.
Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 & O2 liquid at similar temps) & higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage
Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane. In the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once.
I got the fuel cell question about 8000 times
Haha. Will post summary.
5 others the laser beam long exposure shots
Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which Id call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy & prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell.
We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is 97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights.
"Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O"
Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, its 1% inspiration & 99% perspiration 
2 others Maybe I should retweet the top four or five point. What caught your eye the most?
Acceptable, if your drivetrain is very efficient & you add a little manga
Battery industry is world champion at bs. Lithium-ion doesnt really mean anything. What matters is cathode & anode material. There are many choices, but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great.
China & Asia Pacific Supercharger usage above pre-covid highs. North America catching up fast. Europe slightly behind.

"It will get even simpler. Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in & point at sky. Can be done in either order."
There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.
Tank didnt burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result & supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. Were developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable.
Not sure. Theyre pretty close together.
Directionally correct, but Zenit is an order of magnitude smaller than Starship system & doesnt come back & land
Thats the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points.
We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch & landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.
US law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are considered advanced weapons technology
2 others Around 20ms. Its designed to run real-time, competitive video games. Version 2, which is at lower altitude could be as low as 8ms latency.
Actually, weve made slight changes, but the range improvement is >90% efficiency
Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas thats already mixed.
2 others Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox & fuel turbopump injector preburner stiffness, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.
2019 seems so quaint & long ago

Pulling up to The Petersen
Cool, lmk what we can do to improve the product, especially vehicle software/firmware, app & overall interaction with Tesla, as these changes can immediately improve the entire fleet
Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups, many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies
Entirely possible. Social media is a limbic amplifier, which inherently destabilizes civilization.
2 others Probably Fremont

We will add one more PTO day after the annual review next quarter
We are putting a lot of effort into improving the Tesla China experience with local engineering & great feedback from Tesla owners in China!
Yes, but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting, as still no large gatherings allowed by July 7th. Not sure of new date, but am guessing maybe a month or so later.
3 others Haha Teslas all the way down
2 others Will follow up by tomorrow
This does sound excessive. Will look into it.
Will do. I play PC, so missed some of console exclusives.
Probably good to combine them, since they are converging in time. Im hopeful we can announce a date after the July 4th week.
Just us being fools, but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. Its not a good incentive structure.
2 others Maybe, will look into it. Wed need to emulate a TV.
We could probably make a fun punch (click) buggy game, with extra points for rare Teslas
This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you dont have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?
2 others There will be a subscription, but it will be economically better to have bought FSD

September sounds about right
Exactly! A carbon tax is needed to correct the unpriced externality & market will do the rest. The consequences of slow action are serious. In my opinion, we need to convert >80% of the global road, sea & air fleet to renewables by
Yes, it is designed to serve the least-served
Timing is uncertain, given externalities, but yes
2 others Verified should be far more widespread, simply that someone is who they claim to be
This makes no sense for many other reasons too. They dont actually have spectrum priority, they have shared spectrum & nothing about this company is UK, except post office box. Money would be better spent on actual UK satellite industry!
Yes, although Starlink works best for low population density situations

Somethings messed up about medicine thats anti-science. In science, you question everyone, no matter who they are. Facts & reasoning are everything, but in medicine too much emphasis is on credentials, often by people whove accomplished nothing but a PhD thesis used by no one.
Should have a free trade agreement with US. No tariffs at all either way.
Starlink will provide global coverage
As youd expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy.

Tesla, as a side project, is building RNA microfactories for CureVac & possibly others
2 others A lot of functionality will happen all at once when we transition to the new software stack. Most likely, it will be releasable in 2 to 4 months. Then its a question of what functionality is proven safe enough to enable for owners.
Going well. Team is kicking ass & its an honor to work with them. Pretty much everything had to be rewritten, including our labeling software, so that its fundamentally 3D at every step from training through inference.
2 others Im not building anything on ethereum. Not for or against it, just dont use it or own any.
Yes, at Tesla Grohmann
Lithium is common. Hard part is turning lithium salt or clay into extremely pure LiOH.

Starlink terminal has motors to self-orient for optimal view angle. No expert installer required. Just plug in & give it a clear view of the sky. Can be in garden, on roof, table, pretty much anywhere, so long as it has a wide view of the sky.

Great work by Tesla software engineering
Tesla Autopilot was literally named after the term used in aviation. Also, what about Autobahn!?
Gigafactory is the product even more than the car
Reusability is essential. A rocket that is single use is just as absurd as a single use airplane. F9 engines already fire 3 times per flight.
Were being extra paranoid. Maximizing probability of successful launch is paramount.
Trying to set a good example haha. Mars needs people!

No, as range would be unacceptably low (< 250 mile EPA)
2 others We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor & will offer a LR single motor Y in a few months, which improves affordability, while still keeping the product excellent
3 others Yes, in plan. Superchargers and public high power wall connectors will keep growing exponentially every year.

Yes, should be possible to create a neural shunt from motor cortex to microcontrollers in muscle groups & restore movement even if someone has a fully severed spinal cord. First part has already been demonstrated with Utah array, but not as an outpatient device.

Scrubbed for the day. A Raptor turbopump spin start valve didnt open, triggering an automatic abort. Well figure out why & retry tomorrow.
Highly likely down the road
V1.1 legs will be 60% longer. V2.0 legs will be much wider & taller  like Falcon, but capable of landing on unimproved surfaces & auto-leveling.
Nosecone closing is recommended, but not required, for safe entry
Well do several short hops to smooth out launch process, then go high altitude with body flaps
However, we did prove that a SuperDraco landing could work by doing a propulsive hover Dragon 2 Propulsive Hover Test On November 24, SpaceXs Dragon 2, powered by eight SuperDraco engines, executed a picture-perfect propulsive hover test at the companys rocket development ...
All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes.

Working on my Moms cousins farm in Saskatchewan at age 17. I think we did a barn-raising that day.
I wonder if he reads his Twitter feed
Same hex tiles, slightly different mounting method. Need bigger sections of tiles to see how they hold up with cryo shrinkage, pressure expansion & body bending.
Not sure yet, but hopefully. Will need leg & other repairs. Probably SN6 flies before SN5. We need to make flights simple & easy  many per day.
I was trying to channel Herb Tarlek from WKRP en.m.wikipedia.org Herb Tarlek - Wikipedia
2 others Yeah, full name of engine is Velociraptor or Raptor for short
Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years, unlike other auto companies.
Apart from failing to quarantine elderly/at-risk people early (a mistake they recognize), they were right
Over time, since we give all employees shares, my ownership is diluted automatically. From the first financing round, where I owned 60% of Tesla to today at 20%, it has declined by a factor of
2 others Haha, good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add 2m in height.
I think we can get (Veloci)Raptor T/W on par with Merlin. Latter also started out with about half its current T/W.
We must pass The Great Filter
Please trash me on Wikipedia, Im begging you

This is how we make Falcon
More software improvements coming
Yes, its called Cyber Girl
The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because its a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home & work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks.
H2O, CH4/CO2, N2, iron, nickel, chrome, aluminum (not necessarily in that order) will matter far more than gold or platinum for space travel
Asteroid impact risk is well understood, but not comets. Those worry me.
Tesla team is working hard on increasing Powerwall production
I want to do electric vtol supersonic sooo bad, but my brain will overload
Yes. Probably more accurate to say Great Filters plural.
Very real possibility
Significant improvements coming to S/X air suspension soon via software update! Will simultaneously improve performance handling & ride comfort & enable user customization of height & damping, geocoded for relevance.
Yes! Were labeling bumps & potholes, so the car can slow down or steer around them when safe to do so.
Not perfectly at first, but yes. Will take maybe a year or so to get really good at roundabouts worldwide. The world has a zillion weird corner cases.
2 others Autopilot was trapped in a local maximum, labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. Now, it is not.
Metal has a fudge-like consistency near its melting point, so you can just smoosh it together
3 others A lot of work remains. Technically, we have it working in sim with FPGAs at 0.01% capability. This will be a true supercomputer.
Absolutely, but it doesnt seem that govt can move fast enough
Your insights over the years have been excellent. Thats approximately right.
Sorry, this is embarrassingly late. Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now.
This is out of our hands, so hard to predict. Maybe on order of 10 billion km of real world driving will be enough to convince regulators.
Also definitely coming haha. Will only be on relatively recent cars, as we didnt have an outside speaker until about a year ago. Can change inside sound easily.

The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues, GPT-5 or 6 could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion, not an endorsement. I left OpenAI 2 to 3 years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point.

Accurate distance calculation using only vision is fundamental. Other sensors can help, but are not fundamental.
Payload reduction due to reusability of booster & fairing is <40% for F9 & recovery & refurb is <10%, so youre roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with
2 others Starship/Super Heavy is 10X bigger in mass & volume
We really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers!
Sorry, noise reduction has gotten much better recently & will continue to improve
Or a self-perpetuating autocracy based on a farcical aquatic ceremony where the king is chosen by a wise panzer in a lake
2 others Yes, it will have huge nuts haha
Thats an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease.
Hopefully, we have achieved AI symbiosis by then
We will push for ten flights with Starlink
Not having long chain hydrocarbons & lowering preburner combustion temperature make a big difference
Ive been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat & humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though.
I dont want be cavalier, but there isnt an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine.
2 others Its counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant & pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers & stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!
Mostly for employees, but well support public access whenever its safe & secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary.
Dojo V1.0 isnt done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power & cooling problem is hard.
Its quite hard for us to write the software needed to cover basic car functionality, but maybe we could do something of this nature
Almost never need to replace whole engine, but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine.
2 others Absolutely needs liquid cooling. Were applying our experience cooling half megawatt drive unit power electronics in cars to computers.
Winning worst person Ive ever worked with is not easy. Some real champions are vying for that title!
My favorite is one in tension, other DoF in compression. New Roadster wheels will only have one nut.

I tried to warn them, but they just dug their own grave twice as fast!
No, were focused on developing new products & scaling production
No & not possible at this scale
Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok, but frequent (daily) flights probably need 30km / 18 miles clear area for noise.
Its almost working reliably
Theres a lot of frozen CO2 & H2O on Mars. Heating the planet will densify the atmosphere. Its solvable.
Yes, will show V2. Still far from LASIK, but could get pretty close in a few years.
Was just there & weather was calm. Sure hope it stays that way!
Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory & super high bandwidth between cores & efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
Starship propellant is 78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. Thats probably faster.
Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we dont need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately.
2 others Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make 2 tons/day.

Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were 50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldnt blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval.
Good chance something will slip, but, yeah, Sunday is intense
Wow, I super loved astronomy (but took it at Queens, not Penn)! Definitely one of my favorite classes. Senior year quantum mechanics at Penn was the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind.

Boring Co tunnel in Vegas is only a few months from being operational
If some company has solved a useful thing that we can just buy, that would be great! Its so much work to create our own tech. We develop new tech, because we have to, not because we want to.
One person at Tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife & Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was.
Im fine with reasonable drone footage. Just needs to be at a fair distance & not coming right up to people. I think our security was a little overzealous in this case.
2 others Raptor reached 230 mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain 210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust.
Later versions of a larger device would have that potential
2 others That & Giga Berlin are why Im headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines & cures in many areas.
If you ever want to build a long accelerator tunnel, straight or circular, I know some people 
A nightcap would probably work best
2 others People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions & a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect.
Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low & symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells en.m.wikipedia.org Memory T cell - Wikipedia

Just go through resonant modes fast. Its when you hang out there that problems arise.
4 others Over time, outer 20 will have 300 tons of thrust & inner 8 210, so roughly 7500 tons total at sea level or 1.5 T/W for booster+ship
3 others The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC & differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever.

There is already bidirectional communication between human & AI via phones & computers. Its just lossy & very slow (especially output)
Tesla is best understood as a collection of about a dozen startups, mostly in series, increasingly in parallel. Every product line & new production system was invented. Instead of playing chess with the same pieces as everyone else, create new pieces.
Vera Rubin Observatory is cool
Black-Scholes formula is kinda bs. Big difference between a finance approximation & fundamental physics / pure math.
Tesla R&D productivity is exceptionally good due to the caliber of engineering talent

Seems like they should make a whole outfit out of that material
Sorry to hear that. Im sure youll figure it out though. Took us four launches to reach orbit. Rockets are hard.
Ancient Greece had it all & then committed suicide. Nobody digs your grave better than yourself.

4 others Thats the number that really matters
3 others Anyone tracking tonnage to orbit per year for all launch vehicles?
Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster & stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. Well build several ships just to improve the production system.
Exactly. Problems like that have been addressed.
All frames stitched to single frame (tricky, as all cameras overlap in different ways) & then creating video segments for labeling & training. Everything from the labeling tools themselves to training to inference had to be rewritten.

At first, I thought that was a parrot
They remind me of these guys
To be frank, in the early days, I thought there was >90% chance that both SpaceX & Tesla would be worth $0. The press & aerospace / automotive industry at the time (correctly) agreed with me.
Irrational is such a funny word to describe numbers
Current was too strong for droneship to hold station. Thrusters to be upgraded for future missions.
Sure, but which planet?
Therell be lots of green space around factory, but building itself is continuous. The open areas inside are covered. Theyre internal semi truck roads inside a giant monolithic building.
For Dojo, were betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 & existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great.
Shaped like a diamond & aligned on true north
It took an utterly insane amount of work to move the SpaceX & Tesla success probabilities above zero
You really want waypoints this much?
No, but you make some great points. Important to note that irons cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass, so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. That said, iron alleviates much of the scaling problem.
Yeah, we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs
Implicit conflation of consumption & capital allocation is the foundational error
Dojo uses our own chips & a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world.
Felt I had done enough on the Internet (Zip2 & PayPal) that my work would be useful to others. Needed to get going on accelerating sustainable energy & making life multiplanetary.

The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. Its 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.

This does seem like the opposite of open. OpenAI is essentially captured by Microsoft.
2 others We really need better legs for Starship. Theyre coming.
We will be a little below that this year (most challenging year weve ever had), but probably above that next few years
Something appealing about Hawking/Hartle idea, but I agree with Turok/Feldbrugge/Lehners
Thanks for your many years of support through very tough times!
Yeah, but might not need it
Most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction), in which case one or more flaps will extend.
There are some practical size constraints too. Cant be too big to fit in the engine compartment. But, it could be a little bigger. 380 sec Isp would be nice.
Doesnt seem to be a problem. We could probably increase area ratio, given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure.

If you gave an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters, would they eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare?
We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth & predictable. Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. Im a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.
We just need enough height to test body flaps & drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. Will do several flights to confirm working well, then add heat shield & go high Mach.
Glad SpaceX could help! We are prioritizing emergency responders & locations with no Internet connectivity at all.
Seven years for sure to 30M+ new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe. Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.

4 others The new heat pump in Model Y is what really makes the difference in cold weather
6 others Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
2 others The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster & ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling.
3 others Great letter! It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as were actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine & scientific progress is not impeded.
3 others Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity, especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged
2 others Its cool & for sure can & should be done, but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind & solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky)
4 others Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) & more ground stations are deployed. As were able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero.
7 others High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
3 others Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isnt required for Mars, so 4 is possible

Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation. Its already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.
Compilers need to improve imo. Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user.
Autopilot team is making great progress. Reality sure is complicated!
2 others Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note
6 others Our tiles are mechanically attached
But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
Yeah, its not a contest. Advanced casting crushes best-case 3D printing, but casting doesnt work well for complex enclosed volumes & high strength or high temp alloys.
Even GM & Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
3 others Great render. Note, there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand & ship to booster.
We just completed a financing round, but will let you know when there is another one
2 others We do have giant steel balls haha
Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest & most critical product
Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Wont need to wait for FSD.
The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in 100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
High bay should be finished (except for the giant gantry crane) within a few weeks. Super Heavy stacking should begin around then.
Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration & 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but its fun & takes 100 people. Production takes >10,000 people & hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
2 others Aspiring to have no flame diverter in Boca, but this could turn out to be a mistake
9 others There are sensitive elements, but theyre on the inside. Also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what Ive posted. And yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what Ive posted doesnt need to reverse engineer!
Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close  a tantalizing local maximum  but reality is just too messy & weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once.
6 others Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.
That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one.
Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper & lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity & improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough.
Yeah, provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler
Yeah, we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5%
7 others It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.
The crash absorption rails can be cut off & replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
2 others I definitely need to try these tasty cakes & pastries on my next visit!
2 others Mass ratio. Liquid oxygen is much denser than liquid methane, even when the latter is cooled to just above its freezing point.
3 others Had the most amazing kebab ever just outside of Tacheles. Too bad that place got torn down. It was awesome.
What is love? Baby dont hurt me. Winston Churchill
The gauntlet has been thrown down! The prophecy will be fulfilled. Model S price changes to $69,420 tonight!
Will be less roomy with 3 vacuum rocket engines added
9 meter or roughly 30 ft diameter
This graph appears to be upside down
4 others Glad Jen is safe!
Starting production on 7 seater next month, initial deliveries early December
I dont think this is accurate
Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert & careful drivers.
With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasnt clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, its right.
Even if half that amount, its still a big deal!
Yes. Everything is slow to a phased array antenna.
Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is >75% automated. Only wire harnesses & general assembly, which are <10% of production costs, are primarily manual.
Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people & cargo around Earth (also to moon & Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. Its just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but 99% is civilian.
Tesla FSD computers dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes  they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.
Or maybe 2 weak turrets to allow more strategic degrees of freedom
Will release order configurator probably in Jan
Thank you, much more accurate haha
At least success is in the set of all possible outcomes this time!
Accurate analysis. Quite a few ego/intelligence>>1 people in your comment thread haha. Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements.
We simplified this a lot. Its basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point, which is way more profound than it sounds.
7 others More great renderings! Significant improvements coming to the welds.
5 others Yeah, there are literally >1000% more cameras than 10 years ago, but still zero clear photos
Also, system should autodelete old data automatically by default
3 others Its still there, but focus is Vegas & Prufrock, our new tunneling machine
Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but hes in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. No way to make everyone happy.
2 others Maybe a month or so. Some finishing touches need to be done on the stations.
The SoCs sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so its fairly obvious when one is discordant
I have Goosebumps 2 merch. Not sure how tbh.
FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow & cautious, as it should.
Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.
Actually, its my neck 
That free fusion reactor in the sky conveniently converts 4 million tons of mass into energy every second. We just need to catch an extremely tiny amount of it to power all of civilization.
Wow, that would be quite a trip!
Current production is slightly better
London to Beijing would be cool
Pretty accurate. Its not so much DNA sequencing as it is using synthetic DNA/RNA to fix bugs in our code & inform immune system what to attack.
"Doesnt seem to be any life in this solar system. Maybe under the ice of Europa or extremophile bacteria below the surface of Mars. Worth reading: en.m.wikipedia.org Drake equation - Wikipedia"
Firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description, but yes
Mobi-C has too much mobility, fusion has too little. We need Mobi-D haha.

Starship nosecone, high bay & tiki bar
Congratulations SpaceX Team! SpaceX  Oct 24, 2020 100 successful flights
Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by $2k on Monday
Starship is coming together!
Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt).
Critical to humanitys future
I mean, ya gotta have a tiki bar 
Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case.
"Got a little melty tbh :)"
Cold gas for now, hot later
There will be a 360 deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
After it gets to orbit a few times
Agreed. Are these performance tires?
Video training & inference is essential for excellent autonomy
Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
Yes, very helpful. Thanks all beta testers!
Visualization will tone down significantly for production. These are intentionally strident colors.
Yup. With beta updates, therell be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast.
Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesnt achieve anything, but Im confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights.
Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes. R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps.
Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?
Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
Sure, it could be an option in settings
Good point. Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website.
2 others Im in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see.
2 others As soon as we complete testing & regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules & languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long & challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9s reliability (way beyond human).

Small fry. The sun converts over 4 million tons of mass to energy every second.
Tesla team has done great work!
Approximately, log(rate)
Same bot, just change setting to combat
And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment & sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.
Well, tbh, our capex efficiency in 2017 was trash
Future AI will appreciate this
"Little crane: Am I just a toy to you!?"
Some challenges with high winds. Looks like Sunday for static fire.
One of the best games ever
All that was left were broken bots & equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots & brought the factory back to life.
Well, being a phased array antenna, it is actually rather flat!
FEAR 1 with modern graphics & sound would rock
To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades. Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas. GM & Toyota took everything that worked & moved it to their other factories.
Max Payne was great on many levels. Silent Hill good too.

That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night & we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didnt own a house & had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time.
Sure, although it might be quite a short livestream! Lot can go wrong, but well provide video, warts & all. You will see every frame that we do.
New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter.
7 others Tesla Texas team is making great progress! Giga Texas factory will be an asskicker.
8 others Sure, maybe in a month or so
This build should be noticeably better with interventions
Lower latitude states need more satellites in position, so probably January
This is what matters most
Einstein was great, but did not succeed at engineering (and he tried)
Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard! Doing neural nets without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what theyre doing. Reality is the hardest sim.
As soon as we get country approval. This is required for each country individually, as no EU-wide approval system exists. Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March.
I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM & Chrysler were going bankrupt.
Ive spent more than half my life in California & love the state. But, frankly, I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem. Like a sports team with many championships, it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency & a sense of entitlement.
Weve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass
I could not be more excited about the new supercollider! That said, while it is considerably larger, I dont think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering.
Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!
True. Also, fewer heart attacks, as way easier to pump blood in 37% gravity.
Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks & relight would be a major win.
Didnt realize that was possible. No problem if theres a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!
2 others Yes, although I didnt expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that theyre needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years.
Super appreciate your support, Steve! That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May 2009, 5 months later.
2 others Yeah. Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.
Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps 1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.
Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress & pain for a long time  from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production & logistics hell.
2 others Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch, yaw & roll during descent, such that the ship is positioned well to relight, flip & land, would be a big win
Now were talking. Also, Stephenson 2-18 is in the constellation Scrotum haha.

Just looking for problem-solvers who get things done with a high sense of urgency. Dont care if or where they went to school.
I just hope this game doesnt twist itself to tedium out of fear of being canceled
China understands the profound importance of reusability. The era of expendable rockets will soon be over.
Good explanation. 4D is essential for dynamically occluded objects, especially in large intersections with dense vehicle & pedestrian traffic. Frame rate & latency from frame to wheel vector change also important.
Neuralink wont overclock the brain, it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. This is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer, but a Neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input & output, especially latter.
Thanks to a lot of great Autopilot/AI hardware & software engineers at Tesla!
Version 1 is about a year away
It would appear that their calculations were incorrect
I do expect this to become an important product for the world, but probably not financially material for Tesla
Tesla makes the RNA Bioreactor that can make vaccines / cures. CureVac has version 2 in use. Version 3 is under development.
We rewrote all labeling software for 4D. Very different from labeling single photos. Dojo wont contribute for about a year. Its mostly a generalized NN training computer, but benchmark were tracking is frames/second. Must beat next gen GPU/TPU clusters or its pointless.
Am hoping to change booster design to land back on launch mount with no legs. Will require extreme precision.
Faraday invented the electric motor, Tesla the (commutator-free, three-phase) AC induction motor, in other words, a useful electric motor
Maxwell was amazing. Should have more recognition. Tesla Motors, Inc., was almost called Faraday, as it took until late 2004/2005 to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since
Chip has temp sensor & automatically maintains safe temp
6 others Theres no entry/braking burn & hypersonic angle of attack is 70 degrees
Enough already on my plate & Teslas. Maybe one day will do a prototype. Those are relatively easy. Volume production with high reliability & low cost & passing all regulations is 100X harder.
Tesla Autopilot/AI team
Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.
Shakes fist at entropy
The carousel turns ever faster
Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 & N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable & above 40 cycles is not
Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. Whats the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?
Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
If its happening to me, its happening to others. Im getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.
Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid is an equally correct title. The rapid antigen test from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.
Just a scratch. We can buff it out.
"A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer. False positives will roughly scale with # of tests & daily test rate has gone ballistic:"
There are degrees of pos
Luck is the best superpower
Am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold.
Big expansion of beta program in 6 to 8 weeks!
Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged.
Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. Well have to swap out at least one of the engines.
We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise its going to pop the cork.
Cold symptoms are gone for now
The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, youre probably not infectious above 30 & you probably are below 25. Sound about right?
Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey & above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.
Mild sniffles & cough & slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.
Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.
Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.
Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles & 40 cycles is their max.
Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 & N3 (generic sars) at 24. I get results of todays test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results.
Note, this is not the spike protein. They dont consider that reliable.
This a great reference! Worth a read.
2 others Heneghan makes a lot of sense. Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford . General public doesnt realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.

Wise words from Bogle. The point of companies is products & services. They have no point in & of themselves, nor do these indices. Buy & hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap, sell where you dont.
So many things you want & some you didnt know you wanted
13 years & $11 billion  wow
We should just count the atoms at this point
There is such a thing as too much sentience
I was going to say Sim!, but that seemed too obvious haha
Safety is our primary design goal
Terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime. However, we can establish a human base there in our lifetime. At least a future spacefaring civilization  discovering our ruins  will be impressed humans got that far.
Next weeks release is special. Lot of fundamental improvements, both important bug fixes & entire new areas of functionality.
If next weeks release looks good, we will widen beta
Its designed to make life multiplanetary, otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity! Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current Earth rockets combined, including Falcon. Necessary, for a city on Mars.
Haha sexy cropping champion of all time
The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* dont blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.
And cases with high (non-infectious) Ct should quarantine for a few days, while getting another test. Second test determines whether theyre just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards, where viral fragments exist, but person is not infectious.
Unfortunately, there are too many rules around liquor distribution, even in the US. However, we will be selling the lightning bottle & shot glasses worldwide.
That is certainly the intention!
Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields & adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad
Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so its mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year
"Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do. What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of 3.5 vs 2.5 for kerosene, so 78% of propellant is oxygen."
About 2 secs after starting engines, martyte covering concrete below shattered, sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay. One rock blade severed avionics cable, causing bad shutdown of Raptor.
A lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units!
Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative & literal dust settles.
Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well & some parts didnt work at all. 18 years later & thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.
More like he gave it his blessing. It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London.
Pretty close. Definitely feel if I take DayQuil. Frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences Ive ever had.
3 others Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!
No, just a mild cold. Same with my bro. Def had cov2 though. Pc<20 means viral load of >10 million per mL.
2 others Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but its less than 1% of the pain.
2 others Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at <20. Doesnt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.

One day we will fly you on Starship
They have an old version of our software & dont have our NN inference computer
Yeah. They stole Apples code too. Ex-Apple engineer arrested on his way to China, charged with stealing companys autonomous car... Xiaolang Zhang is accused of downloading files that included engineering schematics and technical reports, authorities say.
Rapid & complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling & propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary
Largest cast titanium part in the world. No heat shielding needed.
Our data center was named Skynet as a joke over 10 years ago. Might have been tempting fate!
Tesla is a vehicle for creating & producing many useful products
Fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy
Now *this* is what youd call pointy!
To be clear, this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this.
4 others Where it should be!
4 others There will always be upgrades
Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.
We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point.
Because I am not an investor. Tesla is definitely not the only good company, but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create, otherwise itd be wrong to ask others to do so.
Were still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training & inference.
This is a misperception. SpaceX developed & continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with . Just pointless imo for self-driving. If youre going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at 4mm.
3 others It will be better than human vision by quite a margin
I cant comment on turbopump internal details, but youre roughly in the ballpark. Wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! Arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist.
Andrej is awesome, but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me & Andrej.
Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but its probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.
2 others Reality looks like a strange ghost-world at radar wavelengths. Almost everything except metal is translucent.

We will have special colors for new Roadster, as we did for the original
3 others Hopefully next month
Probably going to a wider beta in 2 weeks
Yes, but only slightly filled
This is a subject of much debate
3 others Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs.
Yes, very sad news. Tony was great.
For a second there, I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha
Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc.
fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what were betting on for training with Dojo
Int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great
Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights
Yeah, truncate zeros & then round
2 others Ok. Overall air suspension height & damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention. Will be linked to FSD, so acts automatically.
Were Going To Enjoy This Cocaine-Fueled Mason Jar Rocket Ride For As Long As It Lasts When I became an executive of a company that produces mason jars back in 2003, I never dreamed my life was going to be like this. A decade ago, we were just another glassware business, but now,...

Thank you, South Texas for your support! This is the gateway to Mars.
Agreed, should be preserved in memory of SN

Last launch of 2020 coming up
I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare
Oh and umm  Tesla  Dec 14, 2017 Very proud to have scored 100/100 for the fourth year in a row in LGBTQ equality. Thanks to everyone at Tesla for making LGBTQ inclusion an important part of our culture.
"The objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware. This is a much more serious issue: The more time I spend in Cyberpunk 2077's world, the less I believe in it Falling out of love with Night City."
Standing down for today to inspect rocket. Hopefully launching tomorrow.
Very impressive mission by China!
I am hoping to be back next month!
"Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, 4680 (worlds most advanced cells, made on-site), both front & rear body castings & advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict."
Sure hope that future doesnt come to pass!
It will get absurdly good. Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Theres some great AI out there, but can it self-drive while playing Cyberpunk  ?
But it is visually stunning & playability is good
Far from fully loaded, but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines
The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. As we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off.
A t-shirt being better armor than a Kevlar chest plate doesnt make sense in the absence of magic. Also, wish there werent level-based item limits in a single-player game.
Original Deus Ex was incredible, Human Revolution was also great
He was indeed quite grumpy, but we did not actually know what we were doing, so he had a point
Perhaps slightly more confident, but its essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic.
Its a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great
Dankeschn Brandenburg und Grnheide!
Bitcoin is my safe word
i love all u crazy ppl out there
Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money
Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make Tesla successful. My heart goes out to you.
Come for the comments, stay for the memes
To Tesla owners taking delivery in the final days of year, your support is super appreciated!!

During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.
Are such large transactions even possible?
They are, although its kind low-key. Tesla Superchargers are being made accessible to other electric cars.
Spartas reply to Macedon
Pretty much. The main value of college used to be hanging out, having pseudo intellectual conversations & partying with people your own age. Now, even thats gone.
Strange, if true. - Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory. - A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is 100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?
You have a point (sigh)
Yup, were just ironing out a few bugs
Absolutely. We will release FSD subscription early next year.
Frictionless AI. What could possibly go wrong?

What should Tesla do with in-car gaming in an autonomous world?
Focus on making products & services people truly love, so that the total economic pie is bigger, instead of engaging in zero-sum/negative-sum corporate power struggles. This is the good future.

Its one or 1/2 if you dont have a car with pedestrian speaker. We couldnt get everything done in time, but more stuff coming.
Its a step in that direction
Absolutely. Will be text & visualization, but could add voice too.
Unfortunately, pedestrian speaker is needed, otherwise no external sound generator except actual horn
3 others We will offer multiple display options
Falcon was 25% of successful orbital launches in 2020, but maybe a majority of payload to orbit. Anyone done the math?
No, but definitely this year
Roughly 95% of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique  not in any other product. Unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric, we ended up with a 10% too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus.
You mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that dont have it?
A few more revisions needed. Probably Beta 10 or
There are subtle, important, differences between US & Canada traffic rules, but FSD beta will be extended to Canada very soon
No, these are just incremental improvements to the production codebase. FSD build is a fundamental rewrite, not just in the car, but also our video training/labeling software.
We need a UI overhaul

Snake-head dog had my undivided attention until winder-head ostrich came gliding through all nonchalant
So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all. Tesla  Jan 2, 2021 In 2020, we produced and delivered half a million cars. Huge thanks to all those who made this possible.
Lets make the roaring 20s again!

Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year, of that I am confident. Cant speak for regulators though.
Tesla is responsible for 2/3 of all the personal & professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it.
Were going to try to catch the Super Heavy Booster with the launch tower arm, using the grid fins to take the load
Might be a few lumps along the way
This is very sensible. Opposition from anywhere cannot mean no progress everywhere!
Seems odd that the opposition group is from BMWs home state of Baveria. Thats very far from Brandenburg, where Tesla is building the Gigafactory. And why would a group that claims to be pro-environment oppose a sustainable energy factory? Arent there more important issues?
Production is hard, prototypes are easy. Building 1000 Starships to create a self-sustaining city on Mars is our mission.
Dojo isnt needed, but will make self-driving better. It isnt enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers.

Indirectly, an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O > CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions & Earth too over time.
Not to get to orbit, unfortunately. In space, photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock, but thats more of a long-term solution.
Hamiltonians have +2V the potential of Langrangians and a play!
I hope so. Wings dont work on the moon at all and def not well on Mars. Also, no runways.
Yes, and then Occams razor is actually third most likely

Prototypes are easy, volume production is hard, positive cash flow is excruciating
Cybertruck doesnt need a garage
Looking into this. No question that FSD should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a trade-in.

Absolutely! They rock.

They are part of the solution, but require lots of fresh water & land. We may need something thats ultra-large- scale industrial in 10 to 20 years. For now, by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy.
Its a good path for fully renewable rocket energy, so solves part of problem, but longer chain hydrocarbons than CH4 are needed to be solid at room temp
4 others That would probably mean civilization is doing great, although depends on assumptions for inflation haha
Were switching to a more sensible FSD version numbering to distinguish between major & minor updates. Current build is FSD 8.1. It drove me to an unfamiliar location in LA & back last night with no interventions!

Waiting for FAA review 
New Roadster is part rocket
Unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure. Their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars.
Were hoping for FAA approval of a test flight tomorrow afternoon
No more stalks. Car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it sees, context & nav map. You can override on touchscreen.

Yeah, Dr Frankensteen
Neuralink is working super hard to ensure implant safety & is in close communication with the FDA. If things go well, we might be able to do initial human trials later this year.
Cryoproof, then install engines
No escaping that for me
T/W will be 1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.
4 others He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.
5 others Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
3 others Tom is great & was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin & Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor
3 others That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel & Draco.

Dogecoin is the peoples crypto
The Second Last Kingdom
Its the most fun crypto!
Have you read ? Its great!!
Might actually happen
It was foolish of us not to start 3 engines & immediately shut down 1, as 2 are needed to land
Extremely misleading image, as doesnt reflect true time cost to people or rain & pain
Havent heard that name in years 
3 others Higher Isp too
Not that easy. This is two decades of intense work. Have to look at old notes, emails, texts.
2 others Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.
2 others That said, the ship landing burn has a clear solution. My greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid & full reusability, without which we shall forever be confined to Earth.
Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky
2 others Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust & propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters & theyre already there
3 others Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as 5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp)
Happy New Year of the Ox!
This is true power haha

Any crypto wallet that wont give you your private keys should be avoided at all costs
Everyone at Tesla receives stock. My comp is all stock/options, which I do not take off the table. Thats what youre missing.
Its meant to be the same price in all countries. Only difference should be taxes & shipping.
Congratulations Tesla China for amazing execution last year. Now on to the next for even more!!
Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault. Transaction speed of Doge should ideally be a few orders of magnitude faster.
A know a thing or two about payments
Once we can predict cash flow reasonably well, Starlink will IPO
This is intended for Earth, but there may be some ideas that apply to Mars too
Indeed! Tweets definitely do not represent real-world time allocation.
Ray tracing on Cyberpunk with HDR is next-level. Have you tried it?
1. Orbital launch tower that can stack 2. Enough Raptors for orbit booster 3. Improve ship & booster mass
He definitely has issues, but the sentencing seems a bit high
Lowest cost per ton of carbon sequestered, net of value of any product made. Must be scalable to gigaton level. Aiming for maximum usefulness.

An acceptable percentage. Doge is much more concentrated.
Disturbing concentration
Good analysis. Were working on lowering min throttle of Raptor, so that there is engine redundancy throughout the landing burn.
2 others Yup. Banks are basically balkanized, heterogeneous databases with high latency & weak security, especially ACH transfers & credit cards.
Yeah. Active fairing half recovered though.
I just want to start a flame in your heart
Heard a rumor some crypto coin was pegging the dollar
"Cryptocurrency explained BITCOIN EXPLAINED (BC Explained ep 1) ""We all have a crypto-friend who sounds like this guy. Gold back in 698BC was no different...""____________________________Like our stuff? Want us to make mor..."
Or did they say pegged to the dollar? Something like that 
Why dont we have these already!?
An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto. Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter. That data, like all data, is subject to latency & error. The system will evolve to that which minimizes both.
I just set up some little Doge mining rigs with my kids. It was fun.
That said, BTC & ETH do seem high lol
Final design is looking Was just in the studio
Machine learning is so amaze!
To be clear, I am *not* an investor, I am an engineer. I dont even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla. However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldnt look elsewhere. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is almost.
Teslas action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&P500 company.
The Tesla Solar Roof is slightly hydrophobic, so water, snow or ice slide off easily
Good chance of flying this week!
SpaceX in south Texas & Tesla in central have been providing direct assistance where feasible (eg save cold turtles & help power the water treatment plant). Please let us know if we may be helpful in other ways.
Somehow, a hash text file using ancient crypto can be exchanged for real goods & services!? Amazing.
Most people have no idea, even though there are so many FSD progress videos posted. Munro understood right away. There will be a gap before the next release, but then it will be a step change better. Tesla is solving a major real-world AI problem.
Speed will double to 300Mb/s & latency will drop to 20ms later this year
Just some used Antminer L3+ rigs bought off eBay. Not really economic, but it was a fun family project.
We have too much product complexity already
Hopefully, later this year
Most of Earth by end of year, all by next year, then its about densifying coverage. Important to note that cellular will always have the advantage in dense urban areas. Satellites are best for low to medium population density areas.
It is still available off menu, but I dont think the range, in many drive conditions, yet meets the Tesla standard of excellence
Out on launch pad, engine swap underway
I hope we dont go bankrupt building them!
I hope they do! It would be awesome
Rockets are ridiculously hard (sigh)
Just a Surface Detail
Sounds like a good idea
This is not about winning anyone over. We are production-limited. The reason we are making our own cells is to *supplement* max production of suppliers. Even moving at full speed, they cannot build enough cells.
Probably mid year, but Starlink is really meant for those who are least served. Bay usually has great Internet.
Nothing if not discreet
3mm of full hard 301 or 304 Stainless is bulletproof to a 9mm or .
One of the engines is suspect, so were swapping it out
Were upgrading all NNs to surround video, using subnets on focal areas (vs equal compute on all uncropped pixels) & many other things, so more time needed to write & validate software. Maybe something next week. This is evolving into solving a big part of physical world AI.
Fremont shut down for two days (parts shortages) & restarted yesterday

Tesla & Ford are the only American carmakers not to have gone bankrupt out of 1000s of car startups. Prototypes are easy, production is hard & being cash flow positive is excruciating.
Looks familiar haha. Nonetheless, the right move. Congrats to Rocket Lab.
SpaceX team is doing great work! One day, the true measure of success will be that Starship flights are commonplace.
Note, buying FSD will still be a better long-term deal than subscription
An area much larger than Boca Chica
First Ive heard of this. Well fix the situation. Im a fan of video!
FSD beta build V8.1 normally drives me around with no interventions. Next version is a big step change beyond that. Tesla is solving a major part of real-world AI. This is not widely known.
There was still a surprisingly high usage of horses in 1940, but the trend was obvious
Sounds about right, but we want to be very careful with this transition period
2 others Yes, beta will be offered much more widely when version 9 is done, hopefully next month
Ok, lets figure this out tomorrow. Im all for exciting video coverage, but we also cant have the place festooned with cameras.
Tesla China team rocks!
Great band, too bad they broke up
Doge spelled backwards is Egod
Carnot efficiency of the Universe?
If you want the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta downloaded to your car, let us know. Doubling beta program size now with 8.2 & probably 10X size with 8.3. Still be careful, but its getting mature.
"SN10 is in Valhalla now Starship SN10 landing and explosion slowmotion Join the Starship film community on discord our new series The Road to Mars:"
"Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development & testing. Note: word Beta is used to reduce complacency in usage & set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation & QA drive teams."
Delamain AI cabs should be able to drive themselves when youre in them & be electric by
 it until you make it
Tesla AI, both hardware & software, is deeply underestimated
Not connecting Tesla cars to Starlink, as our terminal is much too big. This is for aircraft, ships, large trucks & RVs.
Thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present, hence hard touchdown. Weve never seen this before. Next time, min two engines all the way to the ground & restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have issues.
SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of 10m/s crushed legs & part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN
The $1400 is mostly good imo (UBI lite), as the people get to choose how the money is spent, but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole (though it is obviously characterized otherwise).
Update probably in Q2. Cybertruck will be built at Giga Texas, so focus right now is on getting that beast built.
Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid. Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.
Its all hot air in the end haha
Beta V8.3 has literally 1000 improvements. Will take time to QA internally before release probably in two or three weeks.
Build 8.3 of FSD should be done QA testing by end of next week, so thats roughly when download button should show up
Assuming user approves warning & agrees to drive carefully, it will download latest QA-tested FSD Beta build as soon as car connects to wifi
Should be very soon. Many subtle differences between US & Canada roads, so harder than it seems.
We will ask the regulators
Still many fine details to address, but the final product will be fantastic. Theres nothing else even close.
The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have FSD computers, whether or not ordered as an option.
This was way past leg loads. They got squashed hard.
Starhopper is an old timer who has seen a lot of things!

Green flame in this context means engine is burning internal components made of copper. This is usually followed by a RUD (Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly).
It sees in all directions simultaneously
What has become absolutely clear is that the plethora of self-driving corner cases can only be solved with real-world optical intelligence. This is how humans designed the road system to work. Once you have that in silicon form, everything else is just icing on the cake.
This is an opportunity for RH to outdo CB!

If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do 75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon. A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year. Even so, 1000 Starships will take 20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.
There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level. Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.
Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster
Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd.
Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only 5% of dry mass, so its not a gamechanger.

First Super Heavy Booster
Im selling this song about NFTs as an NFT
The simulation really struggled to make this look real haha
We could talk about Life, the Universe and Everything
The [ahem] reach-around
SpaceX did 2X rest of world payload to orbit last year, probably 3X to 4X this year
Yes, Booster 1 is a production pathfinder, figuring out how to build & transport 70 meter tall stage. Booster 2 will fly.
The high bay is measured to fit!
As you can see, I have a long history with using tents!
We will need launch tower for that. Hook height for the lift is 140 m & both booster & ship need to be stabilized at stage separation joint.
Floor is installed, elevator is operational, waiting on glass
Music in zero gravity
You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin
Strongest argument against aliens
Tesla is using only internal & open source software & operates Bitcoin nodes directly. Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.
Pay by Bitcoin capability available outside US later this year
I am accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary & extend the light of consciousness to the stars
Hopefully will happen this decade
He was great on many levels en.m.wikipedia.org Leo Szilard - Wikipedia
Wow, hard to believe that was 17 years ago!
SpaceX is developing rockets needed to make life multiplanetary  full & rapid reusability at large scale. Even if SpaceX fails in that goal, the rockets will still be most advanced on Earth. Starlinks purpose is to provide Internet to the least served & to pay for Mars.
The new Plaid S is our best car ever. Will be first production car to achieve 0-60mph in under 2 secs & it has four doors & seats up to 7 people.
When vast amounts of manufacturing are needed, as in robotaxis, this slows down rate of introduction, so maybe more like winner-takes-a-quarter. Still great.
I once did a road trip across most of US with 2 adults & 5 kids in a Model S!
SpaceX will be landing Starships on Mars well before 2030. The really hard threshold is making Mars Base Alpha self-sustaining.
Given significant architectural changes, including fundamental improvements to pure vision, there is limited value to testing 8.x. Hoping to upload V9.0 & button next month.
An orbital propellant depot optimized for cryogenic storage probably makes sense long-term
Going well. Lot of work for an extra 20 secs of Isp!
Not quite how I would tell the story, but its probably worth a read
They are aiming too low. Only rockets that are fully & rapidly reusable will be competitive. Everything else will seem like a cloth biplane in the age of jets.
Not trying to roast, just being as literal as possible
Wow, shame on ZDF Info!
Check out our new crane
Mars rover looking back
There will be no handles
Shame on you, Onion. This is why people are switching to !
I think there is a >0% chance Tesla could be the biggest company
Solar has come a long way. Now just needs lots of long-life batteries!
This is crazy. Should use Tesla Megapacks for load-leveling the grid. More effective, more reliable and costs less.
That would be great, or possibly via video with full access to telemetry
This comment thread is
1/2 This article is false. - I arrived by myself in Canada in 89 with CA$2500 - Paid my own way through college, ending with $100k student debt - Started 1st company with no funding & just one computer I built - Theres no evidence whatsoever of an emerald mine
5 others Standing down SN11 until probably Monday. Additional checkouts are needed. Doing our best to land & fully recover.
We should be laughing our asses off if its so damn smart!
I wanna know when AI will be able to do standup comedy well!?
You raise a good point haha
Heavy comes in more like a javelin. Similar to Falcon 9, but caught by the tower vs landing on legs.
"2/2 My father & his extended family have been dependent on financial support from my brother & me for over 20 years. This article is actually accurate: Jeremy Arnold  Mar 9, 2021 Everyone has a take on . Mine is that he deserves a fair shake. No more, no less. Wherever you see him on the hero-villain spectrum, I encourage you to read this and sit with the implications."
Its not really possible to match the human brain in 2021 for any amount of money imo, but it will be possible probably in a few years
We are too cell-constrained right now, but probably ok next year
This appears to be widespread. I wonder who is doing it 
SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon
Me in my sick new car (left him the money)
Am donating $20M to Cameron County schools & $10M to City of Brownsville for downtown revitalization. Details to follow next week.
Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas & encourage friends to do so! SpaceXs hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders & essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly.
Nicheman  his superpower is appealing to small audiences

Tracking to a potential 8am liftoff
A high production rate solves many ills
After all, SpaceXs first payload to orbit & back was a wheel of cheese 
Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent & didnt reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasnt needed. Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.
Major new Supercharger station coming to Santa Monica soon! Hoping to have 50s diner & 100 best movie clips playing too. Thanks Santa Monica city!
Demand is no problem, but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale Semi. This limitation will be less onerous next year.
Had no money to invest in Zip2, but my founder equity yielded $15M after tax. Of that, I rolled $10M into PayPal, which yielded $180M, then  Basic principle is that I would not ask investors to risk money on my company if I would not also do so.
"2 others Can be a little foggy sometimes :)"
SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software & engine. Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days.
"Barely a scratch. :) Back on the stand soon! Will report conclusions as soon as we know them."
Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield & stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high. However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating & land intact.
Agreed! Were not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. Were also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power.
BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder, so will be scrapped. We learned a lot, but have already changed design to BN2. Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky.
Glad you enjoyed the experience!
No it doesnt hurt at all
The Earth is not flat, its a hollow globe & Donkey King lives there!
Thanks Tesla suppliers for providing us with critical parts!
Godzilla vs Kong is so amaze much wow! Most insane movie Ive ever seen! Love letter to conspiracy theorists! And yet heartwarming in the end.
To be clear, I do support vaccines in general & covid vaccines specifically. The science is unequivocal. In very rare cases, there is an allergic reaction, but this is easily addressed with an EpiPen.
Tanks for the memery!  Panzer of the Lake
Urgent need to build more housing in greater Austin area!
Ascent phase, transition to horizontal & control during free fall were good. A (relatively) small CH4 leak led to fire on engine 2 & fried part of avionics, causing hard start attempting landing burn in CH4 turbopump. This is getting fixed 6 ways to Sunday.
Looking at pups soon!
What do you think of the unusually high ratio of S&P market cap to GDP?
Just one skyscraper catching another nbd haha
They will be recovered from the water & reused
Those two really could have come in handy for the stuck ship!
Well-written and fair, much like his articles on space
This a good path, but I recommend aiming for full reusability
Special mention of Tesla China
Needs legs for moon & Mars
Some kind of ELO level, updated once or twice a year based on what someone actually got done, might be most effective. Important that it go both up *and* down.
Probably J&J, but BioNtech & Moderna are good too. Some debate imo as to whether a second synthetic mRNA shot is really needed, but the first is a no-brainer.
Coming soon. Crazy number of launches this year!
A tidal wave of vaccine is being produced!
Load points just below the grid fins
For practical purposes, there is no limit. It will just get increasingly difficult to service.
I recommend propulsive landing, as that is extensible to planets, moons & asteroids. Wings & runways are limited to Earth.
Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal glide with no landing burn, although that is quite a challenge for the tower! Next best is catching with tower, with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs).
Shock absorption is built into tower arms. Since tower is ground side, it can use a lot more mass to arrest booster downward momentum.
Ich habe ein Semester Deutsch an der Universitt studiert usw
Its all about the cufflinks
A monkey is literally playing a video game telepathically using a brain chip!!
Thanks to all that helped SpaceX!
But wait how is the core of the earth lit by the sun? Stop asking questions!!
The device is implanted flush with skull & charges wirelessly, so you look & feel totally normal
Congrats to NIO. That is a tough milestone.
Due to lower gravity, you can travel from surface of Mars to surface of Earth fairly easily with a single stage rocket. Earth to Mars is vastly harder.
For now. Costs are decreasing rapidly.
Turns out love video games & snacks just like us!
Almost ready with FSD Beta V9.0. Step change improvement is massive, especially for weird corner cases & bad weather. Pure vision, no radar.
Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their approved collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing.
That rocket is a hardcore veteran of many missions
This is a major problem!
I feel like this sometimes
Actually happened to me in Cyberpunk haha
And even better than the minimum vol portfolio is to take the tangency portfolio
